Dan had 14 peaches and 10 pears at his roadside fruit dish . He went to the orchard and picked peaches to stock up . There are now 85 peaches . how many did he pick ? The answer (arabic numerals) is
Dan picked 71 peaches. 

Here's how to solve it: 

Dan started with 14 peaches and picked some more, so the total number of peaches he had is: 

14 + x = total number of peaches 

where x is the number of peaches he picked. 

We know that the total number of peaches and pears he had was: 

14 + 10 = 24 

So the number of pears he had after picking some peaches is: 

24 - (14 + x) = 10 - x 

We also know that the total number of fruits he had after picking some peaches is: 

10 - x + 85 = 95 

Combining these two equations, we get: 

10 - x + 85 + 14 + x = 95 

Simplifying, we get: 

99 + x = 95 

x = 71 

Therefore, Dan picked 71 peaches.

To find out how many books Mike bought at the yard sale, we need to subtract the number of books he had before from the number of books he has now:

Tom had 27 pennies and 15 dimes in his bank . His dad gave him 33 dimes and 49 nickels . How many dimes does he have now ? The answer (arabic numerals) is
Tom had a total of 15 + 33 = 48 dimes after his dad gave him 33 more dimes.
Since 1 dime is equal to 10 cents, Tom's 48 dimes is equal to 48 x 10 = 480 cents.
Tom also had 27 pennies and 49 nickels, which is equal to 27 + (49 x 5) = 27 + 245 = 272 cents.
Therefore, Tom had a total of 480 + 272 = 752 cents.
To find the number of dimes he has now, we need to divide the total cents by 10 (since 1 dime is equal to 10 cents).
752/10 = 75.2
Therefore, Tom has 75 dimes now.

Sally cut 6 red orchids from her flower garden. 

Explanation: 

Initially, there were 9 red orchids in the vase. Sally cut some red orchids from her garden, so let's say she cut x red orchids. After she added them to the vase, there were a total of 9 + x red orchids in the vase. 

We also know that there were 3 white orchids in the vase, so the total number of orchids in the vase was 9 + x + 3 = 12 + x. 

Finally, we are told that after Sally added her red orchids, there were 15 red orchids in the vase. So we can set up the equation: 

9 + x = 15 

Solving for x, we get: 

x = 6 

Therefore, Sally cut 6 red orchids from her flower garden.

There were 32 bales of hay in the barn and 26 bales in the shed . Jason stacked bales in the barn today . There are now 98 bales of hay in the barn . How many bales did he store in the barn ? The answer (arabic numerals) is
Jason stored 66 bales of hay in the barn today. 

Here's how to solve it: 

- Start with the total number of bales in the barn and shed: 32 + 26 = 58 
- Subtract that from the current total number of bales in the barn: 98 - 58 = 40 
- That means Jason added 40 bales to the barn today 
- Finally, subtract the number of bales that were already in the barn: 40 - 32 = 8 
- So Jason stored 8 bales in the barn today 
- Adding that to the original 58 bales gives us the final answer: 58 + 8 = 66.

While playing a video game , Paul scored 3103 points . He and his cousin together have a total of 5816 points . How many points does Paul 's cousin have ? The answer (arabic numerals) is
Paul and his cousin together have 5816 points. Let's say Paul's cousin has x points. 

So, we can set up an equation: 

x + 3103 = 5816 

To solve for x, we can subtract 3103 from both sides: 

x = 2713 

Therefore, Paul's cousin has 2713 points.

This afternoon Craig left school , rode the bus 3.8333333333333335 miles , and then walked 0.16666666666666666 mile to get home . How much farther did Craig ride than walk ? The answer (arabic numerals) is
Craig rode 3.8333333333333335 miles and walked 0.16666666666666666 miles, so he rode a total of 3.8333333333333335 + 0.16666666666666666 = 4 miles. 

Since he walked only 0.16666666666666666 miles, he rode 4 - 0.16666666666666666 = 3.8333333333333335 miles farther than he walked. 

Therefore, Craig rode 3.8333333333333335 miles farther than he walked.
