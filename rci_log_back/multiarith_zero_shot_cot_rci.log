1st data
For Halloween Megan received 11 pieces of candy from neighbors and 5 pieces from her older sister. If she only ate 8 pieces a day, how long would the candy last her?
Let's think step by step.
Sure, let's break it down. First, we need to find the total number of pieces of candy Megan received. We can do this by adding the number of pieces she got from her neighbors and her sister: 

11 + 5 = 16 

So Megan received 16 pieces of candy in total. 

Next, we need to figure out how many pieces of candy she will eat each day. The problem tells us that she will eat 8 pieces a day. 

Finally, we can divide the total number of pieces of candy by the number of pieces she eats each day to find out how many days the candy will last: 

16 ÷ 8 = 2 

So the candy will last Megan 2 days if she eats 8 pieces a day.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is
2.

Bianca and her mom were picking carrots from their garden. Bianca picked 26 and her mother picked 15. If only 16 of the carrots were good, how many bad carrots did they have?
Let's think step by step.
First, we need to find the total number of carrots they picked by adding Bianca's and her mother's numbers: 26 + 15 = 41. 

Next, we know that only 16 of the carrots were good, so we can subtract that number from the total to find the number of bad carrots: 41 - 16 = 25. 

Therefore, Bianca and her mom had 25 bad carrots.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is
25.

Paige and her friends were recycling paper for their class. For every 4 pounds they recycled they earned one point. If Paige recycled 14 pounds and her friends recycled 2 pounds, how many points did they earn?
Let's think step by step.
First, we need to add up the total amount of paper recycled by Paige and her friends. Paige recycled 14 pounds and her friends recycled 2 pounds, so the total amount of paper recycled is 14 + 2 = 16 pounds.

Next, we need to figure out how many sets of 4 pounds are in 16 pounds. We can do this by dividing 16 by 4, which gives us 4 sets of 4 pounds.

Since Paige and her friends earned one point for every 4 pounds they recycled, they earned 4 points for recycling 16 pounds of paper.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is
4.

At the start of the year, there were 4 students. 

During the year, 3 students left. So, the number of students decreased by 3. 

Now, we need to add the 42 new students who came to school. 

To find the total number of students at the end of the year, we can add the number of students who were there at the start (4) to the number of new students who came (42) and then subtract the number of students who left (3). 

So, the total number of students at the end of the year would be: 

4 + 42 - 3 = 43 students.

Bianca was organizing her book case making sure each of the shelves had exactly 8 books on it. If she had 5 shelves of mystery books and 4 shelves of picture books, how many books did she have total?
Let's think step by step.
Sure, I can help you with that! First, we need to know how many books can fit on each shelf. Bianca wants 8 books on each shelf, so we can multiply 8 by the number of shelves she has for each type of book. 

For the mystery books, she has 5 shelves, so 8 books per shelf multiplied by 5 shelves equals 40 mystery books. 

For the picture books, she has 4 shelves, so 8 books per shelf multiplied by 4 shelves equals 32 picture books. 

To find the total number of books, we can add the number of mystery books to the number of picture books: 

40 mystery books + 32 picture books = 72 books total. 

Therefore, Bianca has a total of 72 books in her bookcase.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is

First, we need to find out how many cupcakes Megan has left after Todd ate 32 of them. 

To do this, we can subtract 32 from 68: 

68 - 32 = 36 

So Megan has 36 cupcakes left. 

Next, we need to figure out how many packages she can make if she puts 6 cupcakes in each package. 

To do this, we can divide the number of cupcakes she has left by 6: 

36 ÷ 6 = 6 

So Megan can make 6 packages of cupcakes with the remaining 36 cupcakes.

Faye was selling her necklaces at a garage sale. She sold 3 bead necklaces and 7 gem stone necklaces. If each necklace cost 7 dollars, how much money did she earn?
Let's think step by step.
Sure, I can help you with that! 

First, we need to find out how many necklaces Faye sold in total. To do that, we can add the number of bead necklaces and gem stone necklaces: 

3 + 7 = 10 

So Faye sold 10 necklaces in total. 

Next, we need to multiply the number of necklaces by the cost of each necklace: 

10 x 7 = 70 

Therefore, Faye earned 70 dollars from selling her necklaces at the garage sale.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is
The answer is 70.

There were 8 friends playing a video game online when 5 players quit. If each player left had 5 lives, how many lives did they have total?
Let's think step by step.
Sure, let's break it down. 

First, we know that there were 8 friends playing a video game online. 

Next, we know that 5 players quit. So, we need to subtract 5 from 8 to find out how many players are left. 

8 - 5 = 3 

So, there are 3 players left. 

Now, we know that each player that left had 5 lives. So, we need to multiply 5 by the number of players that left. 

5 x 5 = 25 

Therefore, the total number of lives that the players that left had is 25.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is
25.

Edward made 37 dollars mowing lawns over the summer. If he spent 21 dollars buying new mower blades, how many 2 dollar games could he buy with the money he had left?
Let's think step by step.
Sure, let's break it down. 

First, we need to figure out how much money Edward has left after buying the new mower blades. To do this, we can subtract the cost of the blades from the amount he made mowing lawns: 

37 - 21 = 16 

So Edward has 16 dollars left. 

Next, we need to figure out how many 2 dollar games he can buy with that amount. To do this, we can divide the amount he has left by the cost of each game: 

16 ÷ 2 = 8 

So Edward can buy 8 2-dollar games with the money he has left.

A worksheet had 4 problems on it. If a teacher had 16 worksheets to grade and had already graded 8 of them, how many more problems does she have to grade?
Let's think step by step.
Sure, let's break it down. 

First, let's find out how many problems are on one worksheet. We know that there are 4 problems on one worksheet. 

Next, let's find out how many worksheets the teacher still needs to grade. We know that the teacher had 16 worksheets to grade and has already graded 8 of them. So, the teacher still needs to grade 16 - 8 = 8 worksheets. 

Finally, let's find out how many more problems the teacher has to grade. We know that there are 4 problems on one worksheet and the teacher still needs to grade 8 worksheets. So, the teacher has to grade 4 x 8 = 32 more problems.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is

A book store had 41 books in the bargin bin. If they sold 33 books, but then put 2 more in the bin, how many books would be in the bin?
Let's think step by step.
Sure, let's break it down. 

First, we start with the initial number of books in the bargain bin: 41. 

Next, we're told that 33 books were sold. So we can subtract 33 from 41: 

41 - 33 = 8 

So after the 33 books were sold, there were 8 books left in the bargain bin. 

Finally, we're told that 2 more books were put in the bin. So we can add 2 to the current number of books in the bin: 

8 + 2 = 10 

Therefore, there would be 10 books in the bargain bin after 33 were sold and 2 more were added.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is
The answer is 10.

The cafeteria had 96 apples. For lunch they handed out 42 to students and decided to use the rest to make pies. If each pie takes 6 apples, how many pies could they make?
Let's think step by step.
Sure, let's break it down. 

First, we need to find out how many apples are left after handing out 42 to students. To do this, we can subtract 42 from 96: 

96 - 42 = 54 

So there are 54 apples left for making pies. 

Next, we need to figure out how many pies we can make with 54 apples, given that each pie takes 6 apples. To do this, we can divide 54 by 6: 

54 ÷ 6 = 9 

So we can make 9 pies with the remaining apples.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is

Isabel baked 3 brownies, but needed 5 total for her party. If she used 5 cups of flour on each one, how much cups of flour does she still need?
Let's think step by step.
Sure, I can help you with that! 

First, let's figure out how many more brownies Isabel needs to bake. She has already baked 3 brownies, but needs a total of 5, so she needs to bake 2 more.

Next, we can calculate the total amount of flour needed for all 5 brownies. Since Isabel used 5 cups of flour for each brownie, we can multiply 5 by 5 to get 25 cups of flour needed for all 5 brownies.

Now, we can subtract the amount of flour Isabel has already used (15 cups for the 3 brownies she baked) from the total amount needed (25 cups). 

25 cups - 15 cups = 10 cups

So Isabel still needs 10 cups of flour to bake the remaining 2 brownies.

Sure, let's break it down. First, we need to find out how many games Kaleb had left after selling 46 of them. To do that, we can subtract 46 from 76:

76 - 46 = 30

So Kaleb had 30 games left. 

Next, we need to figure out how many boxes he needed to pack them up. We know he put 5 games in each box, so we can divide the total number of games by 5:

30 ÷ 5 = 6

Therefore, Kaleb needed 6 boxes to pack up his remaining games.

Let's think step by step.
Sure, I can help you with that! 

First, we need to find the total weight of paper that Gwen and her friends recycled. To do this, we can add the weight of paper that Gwen recycled (5 pounds) to the weight of paper that her friends recycled (13 pounds): 

5 + 13 = 18 pounds 

Next, we need to figure out how many points they earned for recycling 18 pounds of paper. We know that for every 3 pounds of paper, they earned one point. So we can divide the total weight of paper (18 pounds) by 3 to find out how many points they earned: 

18 ÷ 3 = 6 points 

Therefore, Gwen and her friends earned 6 points for recycling 18 pounds of paper.

First, we know that there were originally 11 players and 5 of them quit. So, we need to subtract 5 from 11 to find out how many players are left. 

11 - 5 = 6 

Now we know that there are 6 players left. We also know that each player who quit had 5 lives. So, we need to multiply the number of players who quit (5) by the number of lives they had (5). 

5 x 5 = 25 

Therefore, the 5 players who quit had a total of 25 lives.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is

I apologize for the mistake in my previous response. I misunderstood the question and provided an incorrect answer. I will make sure to be more careful in the future and double-check my work before providing an answer. Thank you for bringing this to my attention.
Based on the errors you found, what is the corrected solution?
I did not provide a corrected solution in my previous response as per your request. However, based on the original question, if each player who quit had 5 lives, and 5 players quit, then the total number of lives lost would be:

5 players x 5 lives each = 25 lives lost

To find the total number of lives remaining, we need to subtract the 25 lives lost from the total number of lives at the start of the game. We don't have that information in the original question, so we cannot provide a final answer.

A pet shelter had 3 puppies when another 3 were brought in. If 3 puppies a day are adopted, how long would it take for all of them to be adopted?
Let's think step by step.
Sure, let's break it down. 

First, we need to find out how many puppies there are in total. We know that the shelter had 3 puppies and another 3 were brought in, so that makes a total of 6 puppies. 

Next, we need to figure out how many puppies will be left after each day of adoptions. If 3 puppies are adopted each day, then after the first day there will be 6 - 3 = 3 puppies left. 

We can continue this pattern to see how many days it will take to adopt all the puppies. 

Day 1: 6 puppies - 3 adoptions = 3 puppies left
Day 2: 3 puppies - 3 adoptions = 0 puppies left

So it will take 2 days to adopt all the puppies.

Sure, let's break it down step by step. 

First, we need to subtract the 20 apples used for lunch from the original 38 apples: 

38 - 20 = 18 

So after making lunch, there are 18 apples left. 

Next, we need to add the 28 apples that were bought: 

18 + 28 = 46 

Therefore, the school cafeteria would have 46 apples after buying 28 more.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is
The answer is 46.

Let's think step by step.
Sure, let's break it down step by step. 

First, we start with 23 apples. 

Then, we use 20 of them to make lunch for the students. 

So, we are left with 3 apples. 

Next, we buy 6 more apples. 

To find the total number of apples we have now, we add the 3 we had before to the 6 we just bought. 

3 + 6 = 9

First, let's calculate how many lawns Edward actually mowed. To do that, we need to subtract the number of lawns he forgot to mow from the total number of lawns he had to mow: 

17 - 9 = 8 

So Edward actually mowed 8 lawns. 

Next, we can calculate how much money he earned by multiplying the number of lawns he mowed by the amount he earned per lawn: 

8 x 4 = 32 

Therefore, Edward actually earned 32 dollars.

A pet shelter had 5 puppies when another 35 were brought in. If 8 puppies a day are adopted, how long would it take for all of them to be adopted?
Let's think step by step.
Sure, let's break it down. 

First, we need to find out how many puppies there are in total. To do that, we can add the initial 5 puppies to the 35 that were brought in: 

5 + 35 = 40 

So there are 40 puppies in total. 

Next, we need to figure out how many puppies are left to be adopted. To do that, we can subtract the number of puppies that have already been adopted from the total number of puppies: 

40 - (8 x number of days) = number of puppies left to be adopted 

We don't know how many days it will take to adopt all the puppies, so we'll leave that as a variable for now. 

Finally, we need to solve for the number of days it will take to adopt all the puppies. We can do that by setting the number of puppies left to be adopted equal to 0: 

40 - (8 x number of days) = 0 

Now we can solve for the number of days: 

40 = 8 x number of days 

number of days = 40 / 8 

number of days = 5 

So it will take 5 days to adopt all the puppies if 8 puppies

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is
The answer is 5 days.

Emily was planting vegetables in her garden. She started with 41 seeds and planted 29 of them in the big garden and in each of her small gardens put 4 seeds each. How many small gardens did Emily have?
Let's think step by step.
Sure, let's break down the problem. Emily started with 41 seeds. She planted 29 of them in the big garden. So, she has 41 - 29 = 12 seeds left. 

Now, she put 4 seeds in each of her small gardens. Let's call the number of small gardens she has "x". So, the total number of seeds she planted in the small gardens is 4x. 

We know that the total number of seeds she planted is 29 (in the big garden) + 4x (in the small gardens). So, we can set up an equation: 

29 + 4x = 41 

Now we can solve for x: 

4x = 12 

x = 3 

Therefore, Emily has 3 small gardens.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is
The answer is 3.

Let's think step by step.
Sure, I can help you with that! 

First, let's figure out how many members showed up to the game. We know that there were 14 members total, but 7 didn't show up. So, to find out how many did show up, we can subtract 7 from 14: 

14 - 7 = 7 

So, 7 members showed up to the game. 

Next, we can find out how many points were scored by each member who showed up. We know that each member scored 5 points. 

Finally, to find out the total number of points scored, we can multiply the number of members who showed up by the number of points each member scored: 

7 members x 5 points each = 35 points total 

Therefore, the trivia team scored a total of 35 points during the game.

First, let's find out how many questions George answered in total. We can do this by adding the number of questions he answered in the first half to the number of questions he answered in the second half: 

6 + 4 = 10 

So George answered 10 questions in total. 

Next, let's find out how many points he earned for each correct answer. We know that each question is worth 3 points, so George would earn 3 points for each question he answered correctly. 

Now we can find his final score by multiplying the number of questions he answered correctly by the number of points per question: 

10 questions x 3 points per question = 30 points 

Therefore, George's final score is 30 points.

Sure, let's break it down. 

First, we know that Edward bought 79 tickets at the state fair. 

Next, we know that he spent 23 tickets at the 'dunk a clown' booth. 

To find out how many tickets he has left for rides, we can subtract 23 from 79: 

79 - 23 = 56 

So Edward has 56 tickets left for rides. 

Finally, we know that each ride costs 7 tickets. To find out how many rides Edward can go on, we can divide the number of tickets he has left by the number of tickets per ride: 

56 ÷ 7 = 8 

Therefore, Edward can go on 8 rides with the remaining tickets he has.

First, we know that Wendy uploaded a total of 79 pictures to Facebook. 

Next, we know that she put 44 pictures into one album. 

To find out how many pictures were in each of the other 5 albums, we can start by subtracting the 44 pictures from the total: 

79 - 44 = 35 

So Wendy had 35 pictures left to distribute among the other 5 albums. 

To find out how many pictures were in each album, we can divide the remaining 35 pictures by the number of albums:

Let's think step by step.
Sure, let's break it down step by step. 

First, we need to find the total number of apples ordered: 

37 (red apples) + 45 (green apples) = 82 apples 

Next, we need to find out how many apples each student would get if all 82 apples were distributed evenly: 

82 apples ÷ 51 students = 1.61 apples per student 

Since we can't give a student a fraction of an apple, we need to round down to 1 apple per student. 

So, if each student gets 1 apple, the total number of apples needed is: 

51 students x 1 apple per student = 51 apples 

Finally, we can find out how many extra apples the cafeteria ended up with: 

82 apples (total ordered) - 51 apples (total needed) = 31 extra apples 

Therefore, the cafeteria ended up with 31 extra apples.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is

There were 5 friends playing a video game online when 2 more players joined the game. If each player had 8 lives, how many lives did they have total?
Let's think step by step.
Sure, let's break it down. 

First, we need to find the total number of players in the game. We know that there were 5 friends playing and 2 more players joined, so the total number of players is 5 + 2 = 7.

Next, we need to find the total number of lives. We know that each player had 8 lives, so we can multiply the number of players by the number of lives per player: 7 x 8 = 56.

Therefore, the total number of lives in the game is 56.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is

Mike invited 13 friends to a birthday party, but 7 couldn't come. If he wanted to buy enough cupcakes so each person could have exactly 4, how many should he buy?
Let's think step by step.
Sure, let's break it down. 

First, we need to figure out how many friends are actually coming to the party. To do that, we can subtract the number of friends who couldn't come from the total number of friends invited: 

13 - 7 = 6 

So, 6 friends are coming to the party. 

Next, we need to figure out how many cupcakes Mike needs to buy. Since each person should have exactly 4 cupcakes, we can multiply the number of friends coming by 4: 

6 x 4 = 24 

Mike should buy 24 cupcakes to ensure that each person at the party can have exactly 4 cupcakes.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is

Will was working as a sacker at a grocery store where he made 8 dollars an hour. On Monday he worked 8 hours and on Tuesday he worked 2 hours. How much money did Will make in those two days?
Let's think step by step.
Sure, I can help you with that! 

So, to calculate Will's earnings, we need to multiply his hourly wage by the number of hours he worked each day. 

On Monday, Will worked 8 hours, so his earnings for that day would be: 

8 hours x $8/hour = $64 

On Tuesday, Will worked 2 hours, so his earnings for that day would be: 

2 hours x $8/hour = $16 

To find out how much money Will made in those two days, we just need to add his earnings from Monday and Tuesday: 

$64 + $16 = $80 

So, Will made $80 in those two days.

First, we know that Wendy uploaded a total of 45 pictures to Facebook. 

Next, we know that she put 27 pictures into one album. 

To find out how many pictures were in each of the 9 remaining albums, we can subtract the 27 pictures from the total number of pictures:

So, there were 18 pictures left to be divided among the 9 albums. 

To find out how many pictures were in each album, we can divide the remaining 18 pictures by the number of albums: 

18 ÷ 9 = 2 

Therefore, there were 2 pictures in each of the 9 remaining albums.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is

There are 36 students trying out for the school's trivia teams. If 9 of them didn't get picked for the team and the rest were put into 3 groups, how many students would be in each group?
Let's think step by step.
Sure, let's break it down. First, we need to figure out how many students were picked for the team. We know that there were 36 students trying out and 9 didn't get picked, so:

36 - 9 = 27

So, 27 students were picked for the team. 

Next, we need to divide those 27 students into 3 groups. To do this, we can use division:

27 ÷ 3 = 9

So, there would be 9 students in each group.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is
9.

A florist had 6 roses. If she sold 5 of them and then later picked 12 more, how many roses would she have?
Let's think step by step.
Sure, I can help you with that! 

Step 1: Start with the initial number of roses the florist had, which is 6. 

Step 2: The florist sold 5 of the roses, so we need to subtract 5 from the initial number: 

6 - 5 = 1 

Step 3: The florist then picked 12 more roses, so we need to add 12 to the current number: 

1 + 12 = 13 

Therefore, the florist would have 13 roses after selling 5 and picking 12 more.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is
The answer is 13.

Each chocolate bar in a box cost $4. If a box had 8 bars total and Emily sold all but 3 bars, how much money would she have made?
Let's think step by step.
Sure, I can help you with that! 

First, let's figure out how many bars Emily sold. We know that the box had 8 bars total, and she sold all but 3. So, she sold 8 - 3 = 5 bars. 

Next, we can calculate how much money she made from those 5 bars. Each bar costs $4, so 5 bars would cost 5 x $4 = $20. 

Therefore, Emily would have made $20 if she sold all but 3 bars from a box of 8 bars that cost $4 each.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is
The answer is $20.

Gwen was organizing her book case making sure each of the shelves had exactly 9 books on it. If she had 3 shelves of mystery books and 5 shelves of picture books, how many books did she have total?
Let's think step by step.
Sure, let's break it down. 

First, we need to find out how many books can fit on each shelf. Gwen wants 9 books on each shelf, so we can multiply 9 by the number of shelves she has for each type of book. 

For the mystery books, she has 3 shelves, so 9 x 3 = 27 mystery books. 

For the picture books, she has 5 shelves, so 9 x 5 = 45 picture books. 

To find the total number of books, we can add the number of mystery books to the number of picture books: 

27 + 45 = 72 

So Gwen has a total of 72 books in her bookcase.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is

Oliver was organizing his baseball cards in a binder with 3 on each page. If he had 2 new cards and 10 old cards to put in the binder, how many pages would he use?
Let's think step by step.
Sure, I can help you with that! First, we need to figure out how many cards Oliver already has in the binder. If he has 3 cards on each page, then he has already used up a multiple of 3 cards for each page. 

Let's say he has already used up x pages, which means he has already put in 3x cards. 

Next, we need to figure out how many cards he wants to add. He has 2 new cards and 10 old cards, so he wants to add a total of 12 cards. 

Now we need to figure out how many pages he will need for those 12 cards. Since he wants to put 3 cards on each page, he will need 4 pages for the 12 cards. 

Finally, we can add the number of pages he already used (x) to the number of pages he needs for the new cards (4) to get the total number of pages he will use. 

So the answer is x + 4 pages.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is
The answer is x + 4, where x is the number of pages Oliver has already used. We don't have enough information to determine the exact value of x, so we can't give a specific numerical answer.

Paige's team won their dodgeball game and scored 41 points total. If Paige scored 11 of the points and everyone else scored 6 points each, how many players were on her team?
Let's think step by step.
Sure, let's break it down. First, we know that Paige scored 11 points. Next, we can subtract her score from the total score to find out how many points the rest of the team scored. So, 41 - 11 = 30. 

We also know that everyone else on the team scored 6 points each. Let's use "x" to represent the number of players on the team. So, the equation would be: 

6(x-1) + 11 = 30 

We subtract 1 from "x" because we already accounted for Paige's score. Now we can solve for "x". 

6(x-1) + 11 = 30 

6x - 6 + 11 = 30 

6x + 5 = 30 

6x = 25 

x = 4.1667 

We can't have a fraction of a player, so we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, there were 5 players on Paige's team.

John had 33 socks. If he threw away 19 old ones that didn't fit and bought 13 new ones, how many socks would he have?
Let's think step by step.
Sure, let's break it down. 

John started with 33 socks. 

He threw away 19 old ones, so he would have 33 - 19 = 14 socks left. 

Then he bought 13 new ones, so he would have 14 + 13 = 27 socks in total. 

Therefore, John would have 27 socks after throwing away 19 old ones and buying 13 new ones.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is

Tiffany had 6 pages of math homework and 4 pages of reading homework. If each page had 3 problems on it, how many problems did she have to complete total?
Let's think step by step.
Sure, let's break it down. First, we can find out how many problems were on the math homework by multiplying the number of pages by the number of problems per page: 

6 pages x 3 problems per page = 18 math problems 

Next, we can do the same for the reading homework: 

4 pages x 3 problems per page = 12 reading problems 

Finally, we can add the two totals together to find the total number of problems: 

18 math problems + 12 reading problems = 30 problems total 

So Tiffany had to complete a total of 30 problems.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is

Frank made 19 dollars mowing lawns over the summer. If he spent 11 dollars buying new mower blades, how many 2 dollar games could he buy with the money he had left?
Let's think step by step.
Sure, let's break it down. 

First, we need to figure out how much money Frank has left after buying the new mower blades. To do this, we can subtract the cost of the blades from the amount he made mowing lawns: 

19 - 11 = 8 

So Frank has 8 dollars left. 

Next, we need to figure out how many 2 dollar games he can buy with that amount. To do this, we can divide the amount he has left by the cost of each game: 

8 ÷ 2 = 4 

So Frank can buy 4 2-dollar games with the money he has left.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is
4.

First, let's figure out how many potatoes the chef still needs to cook. If he needs to cook 15 potatoes in total and has already cooked 6, then he still needs to cook 9 potatoes. 

Next, we know that each potato takes 8 minutes to cook. So to find out how long it will take to cook the remaining 9 potatoes, we can multiply 9 by 8. 

9 x 8 = 72 

So it will take the chef 72 minutes to cook the rest of the potatoes.

There were 8 friends playing a video game online when 3 players quit. If each player left had 3 lives, how many lives did they have total?
Let's think step by step.
Sure, let's break it down. 

First, we know that there were originally 8 friends playing the video game online. 

Next, we know that 3 players quit. So, we need to subtract 3 from the original 8 to find out how many players are left. 

8 - 3 = 5 

So, there are 5 players left. 

Now, we know that each player who quit had 3 lives. So, we need to multiply 3 by the number of players who quit (which is 3). 

3 x 3 = 9 

So, the players who quit had a total of 9 lives. 

Finally, we need to add up the total number of lives for all the players (both those who quit and those who are still playing). 

5 players x 3 lives each = 15 lives 

So, the total number of lives for all the players is 15 + 9 = 24 lives.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is
24.

Your answer is wrong. Find errors in your answer and explain why. Do not provide a corrected solution.
I apologize for the mistake in my previous response. I made an error in my calculation when adding up the total number of lives for all the players. 

I multiplied the number of remaining players (5) by the number of lives each player had (3), which gave me a total of 15 lives. However, I forgot to add the 9 lives that the players who quit had. 

So, the correct calculation should be: 

5 players x 3 lives each = 15 lives 

Plus 

3 players x 3 lives each = 9 lives 

Equals 

24 lives in total. 

Thank you for bringing this to my attention.

Sure, let's break it down. 

First, we need to find the total number of players on the team. We can do this by adding the number of new players and returning players: 

48 + 6 = 54 

So there are 54 players on the team. 

Next, we need to figure out how many groups of 6 players we can make. We can do this by dividing the total number of players by 6: 

54 ÷ 6 = 9 

So there would be 9 groups of 6 players each.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is

Let's think step by step.
Sure, I can help you with that! 

First, we need to calculate the score for the treasures found on the first level. Rachel found 5 treasures and scores 9 points for each, so her score for the first level is:

5 treasures x 9 points per treasure = 45 points

Next, we need to calculate the score for the treasures found on the second level. Rachel found 2 treasures and scores 9 points for each, so her score for the second level is:

2 treasures x 9 points per treasure = 18 points

To find Rachel's total score, we just need to add the scores from both levels:

45 points (first level) + 18 points (second level) = 63 points

So Rachel's total score would be 63 points.

First, we need to figure out how many windows are left to install. To do that, we can subtract the number of windows already installed from the total number of windows needed: 

14 - 8 = 6 windows left to install 

Next, we need to figure out how long it takes to install one window. We're told that it takes 8 hours to install each window, so we don't need to do any additional calculations there. 

Finally, we can multiply the number of windows left to install by the time it takes to install each window: 

6 windows x 8 hours per window = 48 hours 

So it will take the builder 48 hours to install the remaining 6 windows.

There were 2 friends playing a video game online when 2 more players joined the game. If each player had 8 lives, how many lives did they have total?
Let's think step by step.
Sure, let's break it down. So there were originally 2 players with 8 lives each, which means there were a total of 2 x 8 = 16 lives. When 2 more players joined, that means there were now 4 players in total. So the total number of lives would be 4 x 8 = 32 lives.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is

In a video game, each enemy defeated gives you 3 points. If a level has 6 enemies total and you destroy all but 2 of them, how many points would you earn?
Let's think step by step.
Sure, let's break it down. 

First, we know that each enemy defeated gives you 3 points. So if you defeat all 6 enemies in the level, you would earn 6 x 3 = 18 points. 

However, in this scenario, you only destroy all but 2 of the enemies. That means you defeat 6 - 2 = 4 enemies. 

To find out how many points you would earn, you can multiply the number of enemies defeated (4) by the points earned per enemy (3). 

So, you would earn 4 x 3 = 12 points.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is
12.

Wendy's old washing machine could only wash 8 pieces of clothing at a time. If she had to wash 39 shirts and 33 sweaters how many loads would she have to do?
Let's think step by step.
Sure, I can help you with that! 

First, we need to find the total number of clothes that Wendy needs to wash. 

39 shirts + 33 sweaters = 72 pieces of clothing 

Next, we need to figure out how many loads of laundry Wendy will need to do. 

Since her washing machine can only wash 8 pieces of clothing at a time, we can divide the total number of clothes by 8 to find the number of loads: 

72 pieces of clothing ÷ 8 pieces per load = 9 loads 

So Wendy will need to do 9 loads of laundry to wash all of her clothes.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is
The answer is 9.

Zoe and her friends were recycling paper for their class. For every 8 pounds they recycled they earned one point. If Zoe recycled 25 pounds and her friends recycled 23 pounds, how many points did they earn?
Let's think step by step.
Sure, let's break it down. First, we need to find the total weight of paper recycled by Zoe and her friends. To do this, we can add Zoe's 25 pounds to her friends' 23 pounds: 

25 + 23 = 48 pounds 

Next, we need to figure out how many points they earned for recycling 48 pounds of paper. We know that for every 8 pounds, they earn one point. So we can divide the total weight by 8: 

48 ÷ 8 = 6 

This means they earned 6 points for recycling 48 pounds of paper.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is
6.

So, the money will last Paul 9 weeks if he only spends 9 dollars a week.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is
The answer is 9.

Let's think step by step.
Sure, I can help you with that! 

First, let's figure out how many more brownies Chloe needs to make. She has 7 brownies, but needs 16 total, so she needs to make 16 - 7 = 9 more brownies.

Next, we can figure out how much flour she will need for those 9 brownies. She used 6 cups of flour for each brownie, so she will need 6 x 9 = 54 cups of flour for the remaining brownies.

Therefore, Chloe still needs 54 cups of flour to make the remaining brownies for her party.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is

Tom bought 40 tickets at the state fair. He spent 28 tickets at the 'dunk a clown' booth and decided to use the rest on rides. If each ride cost 4 tickets, how many rides could he go on?
Let's think step by step.
Sure, let's break it down. 

Tom bought 40 tickets at the state fair. 

He spent 28 tickets at the 'dunk a clown' booth. 

So, he has 40 - 28 = 12 tickets left for rides. 

If each ride costs 4 tickets, we can divide the remaining tickets by the cost per ride: 

12 tickets ÷ 4 tickets per ride = 3 rides 

Therefore, Tom can go on 3 rides with the remaining tickets he has.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is
The answer is 3.

A trivia team had 5 members total, but during a game 2 members didn't show up. If each member that did show up scored 6 points, how many points were scored total?
Let's think step by step.
Sure, I can help you with that! 

First, let's figure out how many members showed up. If the team had 5 members total and 2 didn't show up, that means 5 - 2 = 3 members showed up. 

Next, we can find out how many points were scored by each member who showed up. We know that each member scored 6 points. 

To find the total number of points scored, we can multiply the number of members who showed up by the number of points each member scored. So, 3 members x 6 points each = 18 points total. 

Therefore, the trivia team scored a total of 18 points.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is
The answer is 18.

A toy store had 6 giant stuffed bears in stock when they got another shipment with 18 bears in it. The put the bears onto shelves with 6 on each shelf. How many shelves did they use?
Let's think step by step.
First, we need to find the total number of bears they have now. We can do this by adding the 6 bears they had in stock to the 18 bears in the new shipment. So, the total number of bears is 6 + 18 = 24.

Next, we need to figure out how many shelves they used to display the bears. Since there were 6 bears on each shelf, we can divide the total number of bears by 6 to find the number of shelves. So, 24 ÷ 6 = 4.

Therefore, the toy store used 4 shelves to display the giant stuffed bears.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is
4.
