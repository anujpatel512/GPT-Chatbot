Q: At Lindsey 's Vacation Wear , 0.375 the garments are bikinis and 0.25 are trunks . What fraction of the garments are either bikinis or trunks ?
A:
The fraction of garments that are bikinis is 0.375 and the fraction that are trunks is 0.25. To find the fraction that are either bikinis or trunks, we need to add these two fractions and subtract the fraction that are both bikinis and trunks (if any). So the fraction that are either bikinis or trunks is 0.375 + 0.25 - 0 (since there is no information about garments that are both bikinis and trunks). This simplifies to 0.625. Therefore, 0.625 of the garments are either bikinis or trunks.
