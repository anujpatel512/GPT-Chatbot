Shannon and her family use up a lot of strawberry and blueberry jelly , since they eat toast every morning . At the moment , they have a combined total of 6310 grams of jelly . If they have 4518 grams of blueberry jelly , how many grams of strawberry jelly do they have ?
Let's think step by step.
Sure, let's break it down. 

We know that Shannon and her family have a total of 6310 grams of jelly. We also know that they have 4518 grams of blueberry jelly. 

To find out how many grams of strawberry jelly they have, we can subtract the amount of blueberry jelly from the total amount of jelly: 

6310 grams - 4518 grams = 1792 grams 

Therefore, Shannon and her family have 1792 grams of strawberry jelly.

Let's think step by step.
First, we need to add up the fractions of tarts filled with each type of fruit: 

0.08333333333333333 (cherry) + 0.75 (blueberry) + 0.08333333333333333 (peach) = 0.9166666666666666

So the restaurant had a total of 0.9166666666666666 tarts left over. 

However, since we can't have a fraction of a tart, we need to round to the nearest whole number. 

0.9166666666666666 rounded to the nearest whole number is 1. 

Therefore, the restaurant had 1 leftover tart in total.

Let's think step by step.
Sure, let's break it down. 

Benny received 67 dollars for his birthday. 

He went to a sporting goods store and bought a baseball glove, baseball, and bat. 

To find out how much he spent on the baseball gear, we need to subtract the amount he had left over from his birthday money. 

So, if he had 33 dollars left over, we can subtract that from the 67 dollars he received: 

67 - 33 = 34 

Therefore, Benny spent 34 dollars on the baseball gear.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is
34.

A restaurant made 9 hamburgers and 4 hot dogs to serve during lunch . Only 3 hamburgers were actually served . How many hamburgers were over ?
Let's think step by step.
Sure, let's break it down. 

First, we need to find out how many hamburgers were not served. To do this, we can subtract the number of hamburgers served (3) from the total number of hamburgers made (9): 

9 - 3 = 6 

So there were 6 hamburgers that were not served. 

Next, we can find out how many hot dogs were not served. To do this, we can subtract the number of hot dogs served (which we don't know) from the total number of hot dogs made (4): 

4 - x = y 

where x is the number of hot dogs served and y is the number of hot dogs not served. 

We don't know x, but we can figure it out by using the fact that the total number of items served was 3 + x (3 hamburgers and x hot dogs). We know that this total number of items served was less than or equal to the total number of items made (9 hamburgers and 4 hot dogs). So we can set up an inequality: 

3 + x ≤ 9 + 4 

Simplifying: 

x ≤ 10 

So the maximum number of hot dogs that could have been served is

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is
The number of hamburgers that were over is 6. The maximum number of hot dogs that could have been served is 10.

Let's think step by step.
Sure, let's break it down step by step. 

First, we need to subtract the number of torn cards from Joan's original total: 

695 - 6 = 689 

So Joan has 689 Pokemon cards after 6 were torn. 

Next, we need to subtract the number of cards that Sara bought from Joan's total: 

689 - 133 = 556 

So Joan now has 556 Pokemon cards after Sara bought 133 of them.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is

Sandy grew 8 carrots and Mary grew 6 carrots, so together they grew 8 + 6 = 14 carrots. 

Next, we need to figure out how many turnips Sandy grew. 

Sandy grew 7 turnips, but we don't need to include that in our final answer since we're only looking for the total number of carrots. 

So, in total, Sandy and Mary grew 14 carrots.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is

There were 28 bales of hay in the barn . Tim stacked bales in the barn today . There are now 54 bales of hay in the barn . How many bales did he store in the barn ?
Let's think step by step.
Sure, let's break it down. 

First, we know that there were 28 bales of hay in the barn before Tim stacked any. 

Next, we know that Tim stacked some bales in the barn today. We don't know how many yet, so let's call that number "x". 

So now we have: 

28 + x = the total number of bales in the barn after Tim stacked them 

And we know that the total number of bales in the barn after Tim stacked them is 54. 

So we can set up an equation: 

28 + x = 54 

To solve for x, we can subtract 28 from both sides: 

x = 54 - 28 

x = 26 

So Tim stored 26 bales in the barn today.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is
The answer is 26.

The tailor cut 0.75 inches off the skirt and 0.5 inches off the pants. 

So, the total amount cut off is: 

0.75 + 0.5 = 1.25 inches 

Next, we need to find out how much more the tailor cut off the skirt compared to the pants. 

To do this, we simply subtract the amount cut off the pants from the amount cut off the skirt: 

0.75 - 0.5 = 0.25 inches 

Therefore, the tailor cut off 0.25 inches more from the skirt than the pants.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is

First, we know that Mike had 34 peaches at his roadside fruit dish. 

Next, he went to the orchard and picked some peaches to stock up. We don't know how many he picked yet, so we'll call that number "x". 

After he picked those peaches, he had a total of 86 peaches. 

So we can set up an equation: 

34 + x = 86 

To solve for x, we can subtract 34 from both sides: 

x = 86 - 34 

x = 52 

Therefore, Mike picked 52 peaches from the orchard to stock up.

First, we know that Joan found 70 seashells on the beach. 

Next, we know that she gave some of her seashells to Sam. We don't know how many yet, so let's call that number "x". 

So, Joan now has 27 seashells. We can set up an equation to represent this: 

70 - x = 27 

We can solve for x by subtracting 27 from both sides: 

70 - 27 - x = 0 

43 - x = 0 

x = 43 

Therefore, Joan gave Sam 43 seashells.

Tom purchased a Batman game for $ 13.60 , and a Superman game for $ 5.06 . Tom already owns 2 games . How much did Tom spend on video games ?
Let's think step by step.
Sure, let's break it down. 

First, we need to add up the cost of the Batman game and the Superman game: 

$13.60 + $5.06 = $18.66 

Next, we need to add the cost of the two games Tom already owns: 

$18.66 + (2 x cost of each game Tom already owns) 

We don't know the cost of the games Tom already owns, so we can't calculate this part of the equation. 

However, we can simplify the equation by assuming that the two games Tom already owns cost the same as the Superman game he just purchased: 

$18.66 + (2 x $5.06) = $28.78 

So Tom spent $28.78 on video games.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is
