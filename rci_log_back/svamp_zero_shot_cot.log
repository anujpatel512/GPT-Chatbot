1st data
Mary is baking a cake. The recipe calls for 12 cups of sugar and 14 cups of flour. She already put in 10 cups of sugar. How many more cups of flour than cups of sugar does she need to add now?
Let's think step by step.
Sure, I can help you with that! 

First, let's figure out how many cups of sugar Mary has already put in: 

Mary has already put in 10 cups of sugar. 

Next, let's figure out how many cups of sugar she still needs to add: 

The recipe calls for 12 cups of sugar, so Mary still needs to add 2 more cups of sugar. 

Now, let's figure out how many cups of flour Mary needs to add: 

The recipe calls for 14 cups of flour, and Mary has already put in 0 cups of flour. 

To find out how many more cups of flour than cups of sugar Mary needs to add, we can subtract the number of cups of sugar she still needs to add from the total number of cups of flour: 

14 cups of flour - 2 cups of sugar = 12 cups of flour 

So Mary needs to add 12 cups of flour more than the amount of sugar she still needs to add.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is
12.

Danny collects bottle caps and wrappers. He found 15 bottle caps and 18 wrappers at the park. Now he has 67 wrappers and 35 bottle caps in his collection. How many more wrappers than bottle caps does danny have now?
Let's think step by step.
Sure, let's break it down. 

First, we need to find out how many bottle caps and wrappers Danny had before he found the 15 bottle caps and 18 wrappers at the park. 

To do this, we can subtract the number of bottle caps and wrappers he has now from the total he had after finding the ones at the park: 

Total bottle caps = 35 + 15 = 50 

Total wrappers = 67 + 18 = 85 

Next, we need to find out how many more wrappers than bottle caps Danny has now. 

To do this, we can subtract the number of bottle caps from the number of wrappers: 

85 - 50 = 35 

So Danny has 35 more wrappers than bottle caps in his collection now.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is
35.

Let's think step by step.
Sure, let's break it down. First, we need to find out how many more kids Julia played with on Monday than on Wednesday. To do that, we need to subtract the number of kids she played with on Wednesday from the number of kids she played with on Monday. 

So, if Julia played with 6 kids on Monday and 4 kids on Wednesday, we can subtract 4 from 6 to get 2. This means that Julia played with 2 more kids on Monday than on Wednesday. 

Next, we need to figure out how many more kids Julia played with on Tuesday than on Wednesday. To do that, we can subtract the number of kids she played with on Wednesday from the number of kids she played with on Tuesday. 

So, if Julia played with 17 kids on Tuesday and 4 kids on Wednesday, we can subtract 4 from 17 to get 13. This means that Julia played with 13 more kids on Tuesday than on Wednesday.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is
Julia played with 2 more kids on Monday than on Wednesday.

Emily is making bead necklaces for her 44 friends. She made 26 necklaces and each necklace takes 2 beads. How many beads did Emily have?
Let's think step by step.
Sure, let's break it down. Emily has 44 friends and she wants to make a necklace for each friend. She has already made 26 necklaces, so she still needs to make 44 - 26 = 18 more necklaces. 

Each necklace takes 2 beads, so to make 18 more necklaces, Emily will need 18 x 2 = 36 more beads. 

To find out how many beads Emily had in total, we can add the beads she used for the 26 necklaces she already made to the 36 beads she needs for the remaining necklaces. 

So, Emily had 26 x 2 = 52 beads for the necklaces she already made, and she needs 36 more beads. Therefore, Emily had a total of 52 + 36 = 88 beads.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is
The answer is 88.

Let's think step by step.
Sure, let's break it down. 

First, let's find out how many cups of flour Mary still needs to add. 

12 cups of flour - 2 cups of flour (already added) = 10 cups of flour still needed 

Next, let's find out how many cups of salt Mary needs to add. 

7 cups of salt 

Now, let's compare the difference between the cups of flour and cups of salt. 

10 cups of flour - 7 cups of salt = 3 cups more flour than salt 

Therefore, Mary needs to add 3 more cups of flour than cups of salt.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is

Let's think step by step.
Sure, let's break it down step by step. 

First, we know that the ring toss game made the same amount of money each day. Let's call that amount "x". 

Next, we know that in 30 days, the ring toss game made a total of 420 dollars. So we can set up an equation: 

30x = 420 

We can simplify this by dividing both sides by 30: 

x = 14 

So the ring toss game made 14 dollars per day. 

Finally, we know that together with the other game, they earned 22 dollars. So we can set up another equation: 

x + y = 22 

Where "y" is the amount of money the other game made each day. We already know that x = 14, so we can substitute that in: 

14 + y = 22 

Simplifying: 

y = 8 

So the other game made 8 dollars per day.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is

95 - 68 = 27 

Therefore, Paul sold 27 books in the garage sale.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is

There are 384 oranges and 192 bananas in Philip's collection. If the bananas are organized into 345 groups and oranges are organized into 16 groups How big is each group of oranges?
Let's think step by step.
Sure, let's break it down. First, we need to find the total number of oranges and bananas in Philip's collection. 

384 + 192 = 576 

Next, we need to find out how many bananas are in each group. 

192 รท 345 = 0.5565 bananas per group (rounded to four decimal places) 

Finally, we can use the total number of oranges and the number of groups they are organized into to find out how many oranges are in each group. 

576 รท 16 = 36 oranges per group 

So each group of oranges has 36 oranges.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is

First, we can find out how many pieces of gum Robin has in total by multiplying the number of packages by the number of pieces in each package: 

43 packages x 23 pieces per package = 989 pieces of gum 

Next, we can add the 8 extra pieces that Robin has: 

989 pieces of gum + 8 extra pieces = 997 pieces of gum 

So, Robin has a total of 997 pieces of gum.

Dan has $ 4. He bought a candy bar for $ 7 and a chocolate for $ 6. How much money did he spend buying the candy bar and chocolate?
Let's think step by step.
Sure, I can help you with that! 

First, we need to add the cost of the candy bar and the chocolate. 

$7 (candy bar) + $6 (chocolate) = $13 

So Dan spent $13 buying the candy bar and chocolate. 

However, we also need to consider that Dan only had $4 to begin with. 

$13 (total cost) - $4 (initial amount) = $9 

Therefore, Dan spent $9 more than he had on the candy bar and chocolate.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is

There were some birds sitting on the fence. 4 more birds came to join them. If there are a total of 5 birds on the fence now How many birds had been sitting on the fence at the start?
Let's think step by step.
Sure, let's break it down step by step. 

First, we know that there were some birds sitting on the fence. Let's call that number "x". 

Then, 4 more birds came to join them, so the total number of birds on the fence is now "x + 4". 

We also know that the total number of birds on the fence now is 5. So we can set up an equation: 

x + 4 = 5 

To solve for x, we can subtract 4 from both sides: 

x = 1 

Therefore, there was 1 bird sitting on the fence at the start.

Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food. 457 students suggested adding mashed potatoes while others suggested adding bacon to the menu. If 63 more students suggested adding mashed potatoes than those that suggested bacon How many students suggested bacon?
Let's think step by step.
Sure, let's break down the problem together. 

We know that 457 students suggested adding mashed potatoes, and that there were some students who suggested adding bacon. Let's call the number of students who suggested bacon "x". 

The problem tells us that 63 more students suggested mashed potatoes than bacon. So we can set up an equation: 

457 = x + 63 

To solve for x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 63 from both sides: 

457 - 63 = x 

Simplifying: 

394 = x 

So 394 students suggested adding bacon to the menu.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is
The answer is 394.

Paco had 37 sweet cookies and 11 salty cookies. He ate 5 sweet cookies and 2 salty cookies. How many more sweet cookies than salty cookies did he eat?
Let's think step by step.
Sure, let's break it down step by step. 

First, we need to find out how many sweet cookies Paco had before he started eating. We know he had 37 sweet cookies, so that's our starting point. 

Next, we need to subtract the number of sweet cookies he ate. We know he ate 5 sweet cookies, so we can subtract that from our starting point: 

37 - 5 = 32 

So Paco had 32 sweet cookies left after eating 5. 

Now let's do the same thing for the salty cookies. We know Paco had 11 salty cookies to start with, and he ate 2 of them: 

11 - 2 = 9 

So Paco had 9 salty cookies left after eating 2. 

Finally, we can find the difference between the number of sweet cookies and salty cookies that Paco ate: 

32 - 9 = 23 

So Paco ate 23 more sweet cookies than salty cookies.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is
The answer is 23.

Danny collects bottle caps and wrappers. He found 71 bottle caps and 24 wrappers at the park. Now he has 28 bottle caps and 16 wrappers in his collection. How many more bottle caps than wrappers does danny have now?
Let's think step by step.
Sure, let's break it down. 

First, we can find out how many bottle caps and wrappers Danny had before he found the ones at the park. 

Danny had 28 bottle caps + 71 bottle caps = 99 bottle caps before 

Danny had 16 wrappers + 24 wrappers = 40 wrappers before 

Next, we can find out how many more bottle caps than wrappers Danny has now. 

Danny has 28 bottle caps - 40 wrappers = -12 

Since Danny has -12 more wrappers than bottle caps, we can say that he has 12 more bottle caps than wrappers. 

Therefore, Danny has 12 more bottle caps than wrappers in his collection now.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is
The answer is 12. Danny has 12 more bottle caps than wrappers in his collection now.

There are 270 students in a school. If the school has 5 students in each grades and each grade has the same number of students How many grades are there in total?
Let's think step by step.
Sure, I'd be happy to help! 

First, we can start by dividing the total number of students (270) by the number of students in each grade (5). 

270 รท 5 = 54 

This tells us that there are 54 total groups of 5 students in the school. 

Next, we can determine how many groups of 5 students are in each grade by dividing the total number of groups by the number of grades. 

54 รท X = Y 

Where X is the number of grades and Y is the number of groups of 5 students in each grade. 

Since we know that each grade has the same number of students, we can assume that Y is also the number of grades. 

So, we can solve for X by setting Y equal to 5 (since each grade has 5 students): 

54 รท X = 5 

Multiplying both sides by X: 

54 = 5X 

Dividing both sides by 5: 

X = 10.8 

Since we can't have a fraction of a grade, we can round up to the nearest whole number: 

X = 11 

Therefore, there are 11 grades in total.

Let's think step by step.
First, we need to calculate how many invitations Carol bought in total. To do this, we can multiply the number of invitations in each pack (10) by the number of packs she bought (7): 

10 invitations/pack x 7 packs = 70 invitations 

Next, we need to calculate how many invitations Carol will use for her two friends: 

2 friends x 1 invitation/friend = 2 invitations 

To find out how many invitations are left, we can subtract the number of invitations used from the total number of invitations bought: 

70 invitations - 2 invitations = 68 invitations 

So, Carol will have 68 invitations left after sending invitations to only 2 friends.

Let's think step by step.
Sure, I can help you with that! 

First, let's calculate the total revenue from the sale of jerseys: 

$240 x 23 = $5,520 

Next, let's calculate the total revenue from the sale of t-shirts: 

$210 x 177 = $37,170 

Now, let's find the difference in revenue between the two: 

$37,170 - $5,520 = $31,650 

Finally, to find out how much more a t-shirt costs than a jersey, we can divide the difference in revenue by the number of t-shirts sold: 

$31,650 รท 177 = $178.81

Let's think step by step.
First, we need to find out how many crayons Paul had at the beginning of the school year. To do this, we can add the number of crayons and erasers he had at the end of the school year to the number of crayons he lost or gave away:

521 crayons + 66 erasers + X crayons lost/given away = 154 crayons left

Next, we can simplify the equation by subtracting 66 erasers from both sides:

521 crayons + X crayons lost/given away = 88 crayons

Finally, we can solve for X by subtracting 521 from both sides:

X crayons lost/given away = -433 crayons

Since it doesn't make sense to have a negative number of crayons lost or given away, we can conclude that there must have been an error in the problem or in our calculations.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is
There is no valid answer in this case, as the result we obtained is a negative number, which doesn't make sense in the context of the problem.

Let's think step by step.
Sure, let's break it down. 

First, we know that there were 23 children on the bus before the stop. 

Then, 24 children got on the bus. So now there are 23 + 24 = 47 children on the bus. 

Next, we know that some children got off the bus. Let's call the number of children who got off "x". 

So now we have 47 - x = 8 children on the bus. 

To find out how many more children got off than got on, we need to subtract the number of children who got on (24) from the number who got off (x). 

So the equation we need to solve is: 

x - 24 = 47 - 8 

Simplifying this equation, we get: 

x - 24 = 39 

Adding 24 to both sides, we get: 

x = 63

2 children were riding on the bus. At the bus stop some more children got on the bus. Then there were 10 children altogether on the bus. How many more children are on the bus now than there were before the bus stop?
Let's think step by step.
First, we need to figure out how many children were on the bus before the bus stop. We know that there were 2 children riding on the bus, so that's our starting point.

Next, we need to add the number of children who got on the bus at the stop. We're told that "some more children" got on, but we don't know exactly how many. Let's call that number "x".

So, the total number of children on the bus after the stop is 2 + x + the "some more children" who got on at the stop.

Finally, we're told that there are now 10 children altogether on the bus. So we can set up an equation:

2 + x + "some more children" = 10

We can simplify this equation by combining the 2 and x terms:

x + 2 + "some more children" = 10

Now we can solve for "some more children":

"some more children" = 10 - 2 - x

"some more children" = 8 - x

So there are 8 - x more children on the bus now than there were before the bus stop.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is
The answer is 8 - x. We don't have enough information to give a specific numerical answer without knowing the value of x.

First, we know that Rachel had to complete 7 pages of math homework. 

Next, we know that she had to complete 4 more pages of math homework than reading homework. So, let's call the number of pages of reading homework she had to complete "x". 

According to the problem, the number of pages of math homework she had to complete is 4 more than "x". So, we can write an equation: 

7 = x + 4 

To solve for "x", we can subtract 4 from both sides: 

3 = x

First, we need to figure out how many pages Frank read in total. To do that, we can multiply the number of pages he read per day (14) by the number of days he read:

14 pages/day x number of days = total pages read

Next, we need to figure out how many days it took him to finish the book. To do that, we can divide the total number of pages in the book (392) by the total number of pages he read:

total pages read รท 392 pages/book = number of days

So, putting it all together, the equation would look like this:

14 pages/day x number of days = total pages read
total pages read รท 392 pages/book = number of days

We can solve for "number of days" by rearranging the equation:

number of days = total pages read รท 14 pages/day
number of days = (392 pages/book) รท (14 pages/day)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

number of days = 28 days

Therefore, it took Frank 28 days to finish his favorite book.

Let's think step by step.
Sure, let's break it down. First, we need to clarify something - it's not possible for someone to lose 62 or 140 kilograms in just one or two weeks. Those numbers are likely a mistake. 

Assuming you meant to say Jessie lost 0.62 kilograms in the first week and 1.40 kilograms in the second week, we can move on to solving the problem. 

To find out how much Jessie weighed before starting to jog, we need to add the weight she lost to her current weight. 

So, if she currently weighs 9 kilograms and lost a total of 2.02 kilograms (0.62 + 1.40), we can calculate her previous weight by adding those two numbers together: 

9 + 2.02 = 11.02 kilograms

Debby bought 153 water bottles when they were on sale. She drank the same number of bottles each day. If the bottles lasted for 17 days How many bottles did she drink each day?
Let's think step by step.
Sure, let's break it down. 

First, we know that Debby bought 153 water bottles. 

Next, we know that she drank the same number of bottles each day. Let's call this number "x". 

We also know that the bottles lasted for 17 days. 

So, if Debby drank "x" bottles each day for 17 days, she would have consumed a total of 17x bottles. 

We know that 17x = 153 (since she bought 153 bottles and drank them all). 

To solve for "x", we can divide both sides by 17: 

17x/17 = 153/17 

Simplifying: 

x = 9 

Therefore, Debby drank 9 bottles of water each day.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is
The answer is 9.

Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries. There are 8 bird families living near the mountain. If 42 bird families flew away to africa and 31 bird families flew away to asia How many more bird families flew away to africa than those that flew away to asia?
Let's think step by step.
Sure, let's break it down. 

First, we need to find the total number of bird families living near the mountain. We know that there are 8 bird families, so the total is 8. 

Next, we need to add up the number of bird families that flew away to Africa and Asia. We know that 42 bird families flew away to Africa and 31 bird families flew away to Asia. So the total number of bird families that flew away is 42 + 31 = 73. 

Finally, we need to find the difference between the number of bird families that flew away to Africa and those that flew away to Asia. We can do this by subtracting the number of bird families that flew away to Asia from the number that flew away to Africa: 

42 - 31 = 11 

So the answer is that 11 more bird families flew away to Africa than those that flew away to Asia.

Let's think step by step.
Sure, let's break it down step by step. 

First, we need to find the total number of crackers and cakes that Matthew has: 

22 crackers + 34 cakes = 56 total snacks 

Next, we need to divide the total number of snacks by the number of friends: 

56 snacks รท 11 friends = 5.09 snacks per friend 

Since we can't give a fraction of a snack, we need to round down to the nearest whole number: 

Each friend will get 5 snacks. 

Since Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes, each friend will get half crackers and half cakes: 

5 snacks รท 2 = 2.5 crackers and 2.5 cakes per friend 

Again, we need to round down to the nearest whole number: 

Each friend will get 2 crackers.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is
Each person will eat 2 crackers.

Mary is baking a cake. The recipe calls for 9 cups of flour and 11 cups of sugar. She already put in 4 cups of flour. How many more cups of sugar than cups of flour does she need to add now?
Let's think step by step.
Sure, I can help you with that! 

First, let's figure out how many more cups of flour Mary needs to add. The recipe calls for 9 cups of flour, and she already put in 4 cups, so she needs to add 5 more cups of flour.

Now, let's figure out how many cups of sugar she needs to add. The recipe calls for 11 cups of sugar, and since she hasn't added any yet, she needs to add the full 11 cups.

Finally, to answer your question, we can subtract the number of cups of flour she needs to add from the number of cups of sugar she needs to add: 

11 cups of sugar - 5 cups of flour = 6 more cups of sugar than cups of flour she needs to add now.

Mary is baking a cake. The recipe calls for 11 cups of sugar 6 cups of flour and 9 cups of salt. She already put in 12 cups of flour. How many more cups of sugar than cups of salt does she need to add now?
Let's think step by step.
Sure, let's break it down. 

First, let's find out how many cups of sugar and salt Mary needs in total according to the recipe. 

11 cups of sugar + 6 cups of flour + 9 cups of salt = 26 cups in total 

Since Mary has already added 12 cups of flour, we can subtract that from the total to find out how much of the other ingredients she still needs. 

26 cups - 12 cups of flour = 14 cups of sugar and salt combined 

Now, we need to find out how many more cups of sugar than salt Mary needs to add. 

Let's call the number of cups of sugar she needs to add "x". 

So, the equation we need to solve is: 

x - (14 - x) = difference between cups of sugar and salt 

Simplifying this equation, we get: 

2x - 14 = difference between cups of sugar and salt 

To solve for "x", we need to know the difference between the cups of sugar and salt. We can find this by subtracting the amount of salt in the recipe from the amount of sugar: 

11 cups of sugar - 9 cups of salt = 2 cups difference 

Now we can substitute this

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is
We can substitute the difference between cups of sugar and salt into the equation we simplified earlier: 

2x - 14 = 2 

Solving for "x", we can add 14 to both sides and then divide by 2: 

2x = 16 

x = 8 

So Mary needs to add 8 cups of sugar and 1 cup of salt to the recipe.

Mary is baking a cake. The recipe calls for 3 cups of sugar and 10 cups of flour. She already put in some cups of flour. If she still needs 5 more cups of flour than sugar How many cups of flour did she put in?
Let's think step by step.
Sure, let's break it down. 

First, we know that the recipe calls for 3 cups of sugar and 10 cups of flour. 

Next, we know that Mary has already put in some cups of flour, but we don't know how many yet. Let's call this number "x". 

We also know that Mary still needs 5 more cups of flour than sugar. So, we can set up an equation: 

x + 5 = 3 

This equation says that the amount of flour Mary has already put in (x) plus 5 cups (because she needs 5 more cups than sugar) equals the amount of sugar (which is 3 cups). 

Now we can solve for x: 

x + 5 = 3 

x = 3 - 5 

x = -2 

Uh oh, this doesn't make sense! We can't have a negative number of cups of flour. 

So, there must be an error in the problem. Perhaps it should say that Mary needs 5 more cups of flour than she has already put in, instead of 5 more cups of flour than sugar. 

If we make this change, the equation becomes: 

x + 5 = 10 - 

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is
The answer is missing. We need to solve the equation to find the value of x, which represents the number of cups of flour Mary has already put in. 

x + 5 = 10 - 3 

x + 5 = 7 

x = 2 

So Mary has already put in 2 cups of flour.

Zachary did 51 push-ups in gym class today. David did 22 more push-ups than Zachary. John did 4 push-ups less than David. How many push-ups did John do?
Let's think step by step.
Sure, I can help you with that! 

First, we know that Zachary did 51 push-ups. 

Next, we know that David did 22 more push-ups than Zachary, so we can add 22 to 51 to get 73 push-ups for David. 

Finally, we know that John did 4 push-ups less than David, so we can subtract 4 from 73 to get 69 push-ups for John. 

Therefore, John did 69 push-ups.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is

Danny collects bottle caps. He found 30 bottle caps at the park while he threw away 63 old ones. Now he has 42 bottle caps in his collection. How many more bottle caps did danny throw away than those he found at the park?
Let's think step by step.
Sure, let's break it down. 

First, we need to find out how many bottle caps Danny had before he found the 30 at the park. We can do this by subtracting the 30 from his current collection of 42: 

42 - 30 = 12 

So Danny had 12 bottle caps before he found the 30 at the park. 

Next, we need to find out how many bottle caps he threw away. We know he threw away 63 old ones, but we need to figure out how many of those were from his collection and how many were from the ones he found at the park. 

To do this, we can subtract the 12 he had before from the total he threw away: 

63 - 12 = 51 

So Danny threw away 51 bottle caps that were part of his collection. 

Finally, we can find out how many more bottle caps he threw away than he found at the park by subtracting the 30 he found from the 51 he threw away: 

51 - 30 = 21 

Therefore, Danny threw away 21 more bottle caps than he found at the park.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is

Dan has $ 3. He bought 2 candy bar for $ 4, each one costing the same amount of money. How much did each candy bar cost?
Let's think step by step.
Sure, let's break it down. 

Dan has $3. 

He bought 2 candy bars for $4 total. 

To find out how much each candy bar costs, we can start by subtracting the cost of the candy bars from Dan's total money: 

$3 - $4 = -$1 

Uh oh, it looks like Dan doesn't have enough money to buy two candy bars at $4. Let's try a different approach. 

We know that each candy bar costs the same amount of money, so let's call that amount "x". 

Dan bought 2 candy bars, so the total cost would be: 

2x 

We also know that the total cost was $4: 

2x = $4 

To solve for "x", we can divide both sides by 2: 

x = $2 

So each candy bar costs $2.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is
Each candy bar costs $2.

Let's think step by step.
Sure, I can help you with that! 

First, let's find out how many items Jerry had on his shelf in total. We can do this by adding the number of action figures and books together: 

7 action figures + 2 books = 9 items 

Next, we need to find out how many items Jerry had on his shelf after he added 4 more books: 

9 items + 4 books = 13 items 

Finally, we can figure out how many more action figures than books were on Jerry's shelf by subtracting the number of books from the number of action figures: 

7 action figures - 6 books = 1 more action figure than book 

So, there was one more action figure than book on Jerry's shelf.

Let's think step by step.
Sure, let's break down the problem step by step. 

First, we need to find out how many cards Nell had in total before giving some to Jeff. We can do this by adding the number of baseball cards and Ace cards: 

438 + 18 = 456 

So Nell had 456 cards in total. 

Next, we need to figure out how many cards Nell gave to Jeff. We can do this by subtracting the number of cards she has left from the total number of cards she had: 

456 - (55 + 178) = 223 

So Nell gave 223 cards to Jeff. 

Now we can calculate how many baseball cards and Ace cards Nell has left: 

178 baseball cards + 55 Ace cards = 233 cards 

Finally, we can find out how many more baseball cards than Ace cards Nell has: 

178 - 55 = 123

Let's think step by step.
Sure, let's break it down. 

First, we know that there were 28 children on the bus before any stops. 

Then, 82 children got on the bus at the next stop. We don't know how many got off, so let's call that number "x". 

So now we have 28 + 82 - x = 30 children on the bus. 

We can simplify this equation by combining like terms: 

110 - x = 30 

Now we can solve for x: 

x = 80 

This means that 80 children got off the bus. 

To answer the original question, we can subtract the number of children who got off from the number who got on: 

82 - 80 = 2 

So there were 2 more children who got on the bus than those who got off.

Let's think step by step.
Sure, let's break it down. 

First, we can find the total number of roses that Jessica had before she threw away any and cut new ones. 

21 (original roses) - 34 (thrown away) = -13 

Since we can't have negative roses, we know that Jessica must have added some new ones to the vase. 

-13 (original total) + x (new roses added) = 15 (current total) 

Solving for x: 

x = 28 

So Jessica added 28 new roses to the vase. 

Now we can find the difference between the number of roses she threw away and the number she cut from her garden: 

34 (thrown away) - 28 (cut from garden) = 6 

Therefore, Jessica threw away 6 more roses than she cut from her garden.

First, we need to find out how many pastries and cakes Baker made in total. To do this, we can add the number of pastries and cakes he made: 

52 pastries + 84 cakes = 136 

So Baker made a total of 136 pastries and cakes. 

Next, we need to find out how many cakes he has left after selling 102 of them. To do this, we can subtract the number of cakes sold from the total number of cakes he made: 

84 cakes - 102 cakes = -18 cakes 

Uh oh, it looks like Baker sold more cakes than he made! This means we need to adjust our approach. 

Instead, let's find out how many cakes he didn't sell: 

84 cakes - 94 pastries = -10 

Again, we have a negative number, which means we made a mistake somewhere. 

Let's try a different approach. We want to find out how many more cakes than pastries Baker made. To do this, we can subtract the number of pastries from the number of cakes:

Ed had 12 more marbles than Doug. Ed lost 20 of his marbles at the playground. If Ed had 17 marbles How many marbles does Doug have now?
Let's think step by step.
First, we need to figure out how many marbles Ed had before he lost 20. We know that Ed had 17 marbles after losing 20, so we can add 20 to 17 to get 37 marbles. 

Next, we know that Ed had 12 more marbles than Doug, so we can subtract 12 from 37 to get 25 marbles. Therefore, Doug has 25 marbles now.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is
25.

Jack received 5 emails in the morning, 8 emails in the afternoon and 72 emails in the evening. How many emails did Jack receive in the morning and afternoon?
Let's think step by step.
Sure, let's break it down step by step. 

First, we need to add the number of emails Jack received in the morning and afternoon. 

5 (morning) + 8 (afternoon) = 13 

So Jack received 13 emails in the morning and afternoon combined. 

Next, we can find out how many emails he received in total by adding the number of emails he received in the evening. 

13 (morning and afternoon) + 72 (evening) = 85 

Therefore, Jack received a total of 85 emails throughout the day.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is

Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries. There are 49 bird families living near the mountain. 59 bird families flew away for winter and 24 new bird families came to live near the mountain from the arctic. How many bird families were left near the mountain?
Let's think step by step.
Sure, let's break it down. 

First, we need to find the total number of bird families near the mountain before any migration occurred. We know that there were 49 bird families living near the mountain. 

Next, we need to subtract the number of bird families that flew away for winter. We know that 59 bird families flew away, so we can subtract 59 from 49: 

49 - 59 = -10 

Uh oh, that doesn't make sense! We can't have negative bird families. This means that we need to add the number of bird families that came to live near the mountain from the arctic. We know that 24 new bird families came, so we can add 24 to -10: 

-10 + 24 = 14 

So there were 14 bird families left near the mountain after the migration.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is
The answer is 14.

Let's think step by step.
Sure, let's break it down step by step. 

First, we need to find out how many cards Nell had in total before giving some to Jeff. We can do this by adding the number of baseball cards and Ace cards: 

239 + 38 = 277 

So Nell had 277 cards in total. 

Next, we need to figure out how many cards Nell gave to Jeff. We can do this by subtracting the number of cards she has left from the total she had before: 

277 - (376 + 111) = -210 

This means that Nell gave Jeff 210 cards. 

Now we can find out how many Ace cards and baseball cards Nell has left: 

376 - 210 = 166 Ace cards 
111 - 210 = -99 baseball cards 

Wait a minute, we can't have negative cards! This means there must be an error in the problem. Perhaps Nell gave more cards to Jeff than she actually had. Without more information, we can't solve the problem as it is currently written.

Paul had 108 books. After selling some books in a garage sale and giving 35 books to his friend he had 62 books left. How many books did he sell in the garage sale?
Let's think step by step.
First, we can start by subtracting the 35 books that Paul gave to his friend from the original 108 books he had: 

108 - 35 = 73 

This means that after giving away 35 books, Paul had 73 books left. 

Next, we can use the information given in the problem to set up an equation: 

73 + x = 62 

Here, x represents the number of books that Paul sold in the garage sale. We set up the equation by adding the number of books he sold to the 73 books he had left, and setting that equal to the 62 books he ended up with. 

To solve for x, we can subtract 73 from both sides of the equation: 

x = 62 - 73 

x = -11 

This means that Paul actually ended up with 11 fewer books than he started with, so he must have sold 11 books in the garage sale.

Next, let's find out how many cups of sugar she needs. 

The recipe calls for 9 cups of sugar. 

Finally, let's find the difference between the cups of flour and sugar. 

Mary needs to add 10 cups of flour and 9 cups of sugar are required. 

So, she needs to add 10 - 9 = 1 more cup of flour than cups of sugar.

The grasshopper and the frog had a jumping contest. The grasshopper jumped 9 inches and the frog jumped 12 inches. How much farther did the frog jump than the grasshopper?
Let's think step by step.
Sure, let's break it down. First, we need to find the difference between the distances jumped by the frog and the grasshopper. To do this, we can subtract the distance jumped by the grasshopper from the distance jumped by the frog. 

So, the calculation would be: 

12 inches (distance jumped by the frog) - 9 inches (distance jumped by the grasshopper) = 3 inches 

Therefore, the frog jumped 3 inches farther than the grasshopper.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is
The answer is 3.

There were 9 roses and 6 orchids in the vase. Jessica cut some more roses and orchids from her flower garden. There are now 13 orchids and 3 roses in the vase. How many more orchids than roses are there in the vase now?
Let's think step by step.
Sure, let's break it down. 

First, we need to find out how many roses and orchids Jessica added to the vase. We can do this by subtracting the original number of flowers from the new number of flowers: 

- New number of orchids = 13 
- Original number of orchids = 6 
- Jessica added 13 - 6 = 7 orchids 

- New number of roses = 3 
- Original number of roses = 9 
- Jessica added 3 - 9 = -6 roses 

Next, we need to figure out how many more orchids than roses there are in the vase now. We can do this by subtracting the number of roses from the number of orchids: 

- Number of orchids = 13 + 7 = 20 
- Number of roses = 3 - 6 = -3 

Since we can't have a negative number of roses, we'll assume that Jessica didn't actually remove any roses from the vase. Therefore, the number of roses is still 9. 

- Number of orchids = 20 
- Number of roses = 9 

So, there are 11 more orchids than roses in the vase now.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is
11.

A farmer had 175 tomatoes and 77 potatoes in his garden. If he picked 172 potatoes How many tomatoes and potatoes does he have left?
Let's think step by step.
Sure, let's break it down. 

First, we need to find out how many tomatoes the farmer had to begin with. We know he had a total of 175 tomatoes and 77 potatoes, so:

175 tomatoes + 77 potatoes = 252 total plants

Next, we need to subtract the number of potatoes he picked from the original number of potatoes:

77 potatoes - 172 picked potatoes =  -95 potatoes

Uh oh, it looks like the farmer picked more potatoes than he had to begin with! We can't have a negative number of plants, so we'll need to adjust our calculations. 

One option is to assume that the farmer made a mistake and actually had 172 potatoes to begin with, not 77. In that case, we can recalculate as follows:

175 tomatoes + 172 potatoes = 347 total plants
172 picked potatoes
= 175 tomatoes + 0 potatoes
= 175 tomatoes

So the farmer would have 175 tomatoes and 0 potatoes left. 

Alternatively, we could assume that the farmer had fewer potatoes to begin with and adjust the problem accordingly. For example, if we assume he had 50 potatoes to begin with, we could calculate:

175 tomatoes + 50 potatoes = 225 total plants

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is
If we assume the farmer had 172 potatoes to begin with, then the answer is:

175 tomatoes + 172 potatoes = 347 total plants
172 picked potatoes
= 175 tomatoes + 0 potatoes
= 175 tomatoes

So the farmer has 175 tomatoes and 0 potatoes left.

First, we need to find out how many cakes Baker had in total after buying the 139 new cakes. To do this, we can add the number of cakes he started with (8) to the number of cakes he bought (139): 

8 + 139 = 147 

So Baker had 147 cakes in total. 

Next, we need to find out how many cakes he sold. We know he sold 145 cakes, so we can subtract that from the total number of cakes he had: 

147 - 145 = 2 

Baker sold 2 more cakes than he bought.

Let's think step by step.
Sure, I can help you with that! 

First, we need to find out how many raisin cookies Helen baked yesterday. To do that, we add up the number of raisin cookies she baked yesterday:

First, we need to find out how many bags of cans Tiffany had in total after finding 7 more bags on the next day. To do this, we can add the number of bags she had on Monday (8) to the number of bags she found the next day (7). 

8 + 7 = 15 

So Tiffany had 15 bags of cans in total. 

Next, we need to find out how many more bags she had on Monday than she found on the next day. To do this, we can subtract the number of bags she found on the next day (7) from the number of bags she had on Monday (8). 

8 - 7 = 1 

Therefore, Tiffany had 1 more bag of cans on Monday than she found on the next day.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is
1.

Paco had 25 cookies. He ate 5 of them. Then he bought 3 more cookies How many more cookies did he eat than those he bought?
Let's think step by step.
Sure, let's break it down. 

First, Paco had 25 cookies. 

Then, he ate 5 of them. So how many cookies does he have left? 

25 - 5 = 20 cookies left. 

Next, he bought 3 more cookies. So how many cookies does he have now? 

20 + 3 = 23 cookies. 

Finally, the question asks how many more cookies did he eat than those he bought. 

So we can subtract the number of cookies he bought from the number of cookies he ate: 

5 - 3 = 2 

Therefore, Paco ate 2 more cookies than he bought.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is
The answer is 2.

Baker made 157 cakes and 169 pastries. If he sold 158 cakes and 147 pastries How many more cakes than pastries did baker sell?
Let's think step by step.
Sure, let's break it down. 

First, we need to find out how many cakes and pastries Baker has left after selling some of them. 

To do that, we can subtract the number of cakes and pastries sold from the original number of cakes and pastries Baker made: 

- Cakes left = 157 - 158 = -1 
- Pastries left = 169 - 147 = 22 

Uh oh, it looks like Baker sold more cakes than he made! But we can still answer the question by looking at the difference between the number of cakes and pastries sold: 

- Cakes sold - pastries sold = 158 - 147 = 11 

So Baker sold 11 more cakes than pastries.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is

First, we know that Edward spent $6 to buy 2 books, so we can set up an equation: 

2x = 6 

where x is the cost of each book. 

Next, we can solve for x by dividing both sides of the equation by 2: 

x = 3 

So each book costs $3. 

Now, we also know that Edward has $12, so we can check our answer by seeing if he could have bought 4 books with that amount: 

4 x $3 = $12 

And indeed, he could have bought 4 books with $12.

Sure, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find out how many apps and files Dave had in total before deleting some. We know he had 11 apps and 3 files, so:

11 apps + 3 files = 14 total apps and files

Next, we need to figure out how many apps and files Dave deleted. We know he was left with 24 files and 2 apps, so:

24 files + 2 apps = 26 total files and apps after deleting some

To find out how many he deleted, we can subtract the total after deleting from the total before deleting:

26 total - 14 original = 12 deleted apps and files

Finally, we can calculate how many more files than apps Dave has left on his phone:

24 files - 2 apps = 22 more files than apps

So Dave has 22 more files than apps left on his phone.

David did 56 more push-ups than Zachary in gym class today. If David did 38 push-ups How many push-ups did Zachary and David do altogether?
Let's think step by step.
Sure, let's break it down. 

First, we need to figure out how many push-ups Zachary did. We know that David did 56 more push-ups than Zachary, and David did 38 push-ups. So we can set up an equation: 

David's push-ups = Zachary's push-ups + 56 

38 = Zachary's push-ups + 56 

Subtract 56 from both sides: 

-18 = Zachary's push-ups 

So Zachary did -18 push-ups, which doesn't make sense. We made a mistake somewhere. 

Let's try a different approach. We know that David did 56 more push-ups than Zachary, so we can set up another equation: 

David's push-ups = Zachary's push-ups + 56 

We also know that David did 38 push-ups. So we can substitute that in: 

38 = Zachary's push-ups + 56 

Subtract 56 from both sides: 

-18 = Zachary's push-ups 

So Zachary did -18 push-ups again. That's not right. 

Let's try one more time. We know that David did 56 more push-ups than Zachary, so we can set up an equation

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is
We still need to figure out how many push-ups Zachary did. 

If David did 38 push-ups and he did 56 more than Zachary, we can set up an equation: 

David's push-ups = Zachary's push-ups + 56 

38 = Zachary's push-ups + 56 

Subtract 56 from both sides: 

-18 = Zachary's push-ups 

So Zachary did -18 push-ups. That doesn't make sense, so we made a mistake somewhere. 

It's possible that there was an error in the original problem. If we assume that David did 56 push-ups instead of 38, we can solve for Zachary: 

David's push-ups = Zachary's push-ups + 56 

56 = Zachary's push-ups + 56 

Subtract 56 from both sides: 

0 = Zachary's push-ups 

So Zachary did 0 push-ups. 

Therefore, David and Zachary did 56 push-ups altogether.

He then went to see the oranges being harvested. He found out that they harvest 41 sacks of unripe oranges and 86 sacks of ripe oranges per day. How many more sacks of ripe oranges than unripe oranges are harvested per day?
Let's think step by step.
Sure, I can help you with that! First, we need to find the difference between the number of sacks of ripe oranges and unripe oranges harvested per day. To do that, we can subtract the number of unripe oranges from the number of ripe oranges:

86 sacks of ripe oranges - 41 sacks of unripe oranges = 45 more sacks of ripe oranges

So, there are 45 more sacks of ripe oranges harvested per day than unripe oranges.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is
The answer is 45.

Julia played tag with 5 kids on monday. She played tag with some more kids on tuesday. If she played with a total of 15 kids How many kids did she play with on tuesday?
Let's think step by step.
Sure, let's break it down. 

First, we know that Julia played tag with 5 kids on Monday. 

Next, we need to figure out how many kids she played with on Tuesday. We know that the total number of kids she played with over both days was 15. So we can set up an equation: 

5 + x = 15 

Here, x represents the number of kids she played with on Tuesday. 

To solve for x, we can subtract 5 from both sides: 

x = 10 

So Julia played with 10 kids on Tuesday.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is
The answer is 10.

Paul got a box of 457 erasers and 617 crayons for his birthday. At the end of the school year he only had 523 crayons left while not having lost a single eraser. How many more crayons than erasers did he have left?
Let's think step by step.
Sure, let's break it down. 

First, we need to find out how many crayons Paul used during the school year. To do this, we can subtract the number of crayons he had left from the number he started with: 

617 - 523 = 94 crayons used 

Next, we can find out how many more crayons than erasers Paul had left by subtracting the number of erasers he started with from the number of crayons he had left: 

523 - 457 = 66 more crayons than erasers 

So, Paul had 66 more crayons than erasers left at the end of the school year.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is
66.

4 birds and 46 storks were sitting on the fence. 6 more birds came to join them. How many birds are sitting on the fence?
Let's think step by step.
Sure, let's break it down. 

First, we need to add the number of birds and storks that were already sitting on the fence: 

4 birds + 46 storks = 50 

So, there were 50 birds and storks on the fence. 

Next, 6 more birds came to join them, so we need to add 6 to the previous total: 

50 + 6 = 56 

Therefore, there are now 56 birds sitting on the fence.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is
56.

The ring toss game at the carnival made 325 dollars in the first 154 days and 114 dollars in the remaining 57 days. How much did they make per day in the remaining 57 days at the carnival?
Let's think step by step.
Sure, let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find the total amount of money made at the carnival. We can do this by adding the amount made in the first 154 days to the amount made in the remaining 57 days:

325 + 114 = 439

So the total amount made at the carnival is $439.

Next, we need to find out how much money was made per day in the remaining 57 days. To do this, we can divide the amount made in the remaining 57 days by the number of days:

114 / 57 = 2

So they made $2 per day in the remaining 57 days at the carnival.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is
2.

After eating a hearty meal they went to see the Buckingham palace. There, Rachel learned that 45 visitors came to the Buckingham palace on the previous day. If 829 people visited the Buckingham palace within the past 85 days How many visitors visited the Buckingham palace on that day?
Let's think step by step.
Sure, let's break it down. 

First, we know that 45 visitors came to the Buckingham palace on the previous day. 

Next, we know that 829 people visited the Buckingham palace within the past 85 days. 

To find out how many visitors visited the Buckingham palace on that specific day, we need to divide the total number of visitors by the number of days. 

So, we can set up an equation: 

829 visitors / 85 days = x visitors / 1 day 

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply: 

829 visitors * 1 day = 85 days * x visitors 

Simplifying: 

829 visitors = 85x visitors 

Dividing both sides by 85: 

x = 9.76 

Rounding to the nearest whole number, we can say that approximately 10 visitors visited the Buckingham palace on that day.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is
The answer is approximately 10 visitors.
