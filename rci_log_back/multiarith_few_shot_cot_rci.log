Q: Oliver was organizing his baseball cards in a binder with 3 on each page. If he had 2 new cards and 10 old cards to put in the binder, how many pages would he use?

Your answer is wrong. Find errors in your answer and explain why. Do not provide a corrected solution.
I apologize for the mistake in my previous answer. I incorrectly calculated the number of pages needed for the old cards. The correct calculation is 10 cards ÷ 3 cards per page = 3 with a remainder of 1, so he needs 4 pages for the old cards. Adding the 1 page needed for the new cards, the total number of pages needed is 4 + 1 = 5.
Based on the errors you found, what is the corrected solution?
I apologize for the confusion. The corrected solution is:

Oliver has 2 new cards and 10 old cards, so he has a total of 12 cards to put in the binder. If he puts 3 cards on each page, he will need 4 pages for the old cards (10 cards ÷ 3 cards per page = 3 with a remainder of 1, so he needs 4 pages).

Q: Paige's team won their dodgeball game and scored 41 points total. If Paige scored 11 of the points and everyone else scored 6 points each, how many players were on her team?
A:
Paige scored 11 points and everyone else scored 6 points each. Let's call the number of other players on the team "x". So the total number of points scored can be represented as 11 + 6x. We know that the total score was 41, so we can set up the equation 11 + 6x = 41. Solving for x, we get x = 5. So there were 5 other players on Paige's team, making a total of 6 players. The answer is 6.
