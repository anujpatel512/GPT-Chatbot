Trenton sells electronic supplies. Each week he earns 190 dollars plus commission equal to 0.04 of his sales. This week his goal is to earn no less than 500 dollars. How much sales  he must make to reach his goal? The answer (arabic numerals) is
To find out how much sales Trenton must make to reach his goal, we can set up an equation:

Total earnings = 190 + 0.04(sales)

We want to find out when the total earnings will be at least 500 dollars, so we can set up an inequality:

190 + 0.04(sales) ≥ 500

Subtracting 190 from both sides, we get:

0.04(sales) ≥ 310

Dividing both sides by 0.04, we get:

sales ≥ 7750

Therefore, Trenton must make at least 7750 dollars in sales to reach his goal of earning no less than 500 dollars.
