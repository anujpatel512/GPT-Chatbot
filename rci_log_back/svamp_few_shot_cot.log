Q: Because of the decision Sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food. 182 students suggested adding mashed potatoes while others suggested adding bacon to the menu. If 166 more students suggested adding bacon than those that suggested mashed potatoes How many students suggested bacon?
A:
Let's call the number of students who suggested mashed potatoes "x". Then we know that the number of students who suggested bacon is "x + 166" (because 166 more students suggested bacon than mashed potatoes). We also know that the total number of students who made suggestions is 182. So we can set up an equation: 

x + (x + 166) = 182 

Simplifying this equation, we get: 

2x + 166 = 182 

Subtracting 166 from both sides: 

2x = 16 

Dividing both sides by 2: 

x = 8 

So 8 students suggested mashed potatoes, and the number who suggested bacon is x + 166 = 8 + 166 = 174. The answer is 174.

Q: Jessie currently weighs 9 kilograms. After she started to go jogging everyday she lost 62 kilograms in the first week and 140 kilograms in the second week. How much did she weigh before starting to jog?
A:
The question is asking for Jessie's weight before she started jogging. We know that she currently weighs 9 kilograms. If she lost 62 kilograms in the first week and 140 kilograms in the second week, that means she lost a total of 62 + 140 = 202 kilograms. To find her original weight, we need to add the 202 kilograms she lost to her current weight of 9 kilograms. 202 + 9 = 211. So Jessie weighed 211 kilograms before she started jogging.
