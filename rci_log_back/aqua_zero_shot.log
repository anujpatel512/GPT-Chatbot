there are more than 501 students in a school such that 20% of them exactly took physics and 28% of them exactly took math. What could be the least possible no of students in the school? Answer Choices: (A) 550 (B) 570 (C) 600 (D) 700 (E) none of these Among A through E, the answer is
The least possible number of students in the school can be found by assuming that all students who took physics are also included in the group of students who took math. This means that the total percentage of students who took physics and/or math is 28%. 

Let's call the total number of students in the school "x". Then, we can set up the following equation: 

20% of x + (28% - 20%) of x = 28% of x 

Simplifying this equation, we get: 

0.2x + 0.08x = 0.28x 

0.28x - 0.28x = 0 

0.08x = 0 

This equation tells us that x can be any number, since any number multiplied by 0 is 0. However, we know that x must be greater than 501, since there are more than 501 students in the school. 

Therefore, the least possible number of students in the school is 570, which is answer choice (B).

The sum of k consecutive integers is 51. If the least integer is -50, then k = Answer Choices: (A) 40 (B) 62 (C) 82 (D) 92 (E) 102 Among A through E, the answer is
(A) 40. 

To solve this problem, we can use the formula for the sum of consecutive integers: 

sum = (number of integers) * (average of integers) 

Let x be the first integer in the sequence. Then the sum of k consecutive integers starting with x is: 

51 = k * (x + (x + 1) + ... + (x + k - 1)) / k 

Simplifying this expression, we get: 

51 = k * (2x + k - 1) / 2 

Multiplying both sides by 2 and rearranging, we get: 

k^2 + (2x - 1)k - 102 = 0 

Since the least integer is -50, we know that x = -50. Substituting this into the equation above, we get: 

k^2 - 101k - 102 = 0 

Factoring this quadratic equation, we get: 

(k - 40)(k + 41) = 0 

Since k must be a positive integer, the only solution is k = 40. Therefore, the answer is (A) 40.

Answer Choices: (A) 26.2% (B) 32.8% (C) 43.7% (D) 59.0% (E) 65.6% Among A through E, the answer is
To solve this problem, we can use the binomial probability formula: P(X=k) = (n choose k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k), where n is the number of trials, k is the number of successes, p is the probability of success, and (n choose k) is the binomial coefficient.

In this case, n = 5, k = 4, p = 0.9, and (n choose k) = 5 choose 4 = 5.

Plugging in these values, we get:

P(X=4) = 5 * 0.9^4 * 0.1^1 = 0.32805

Tires of a certain brand, when purchased new, last for four years. A customer can choose to purchase the new tires at a cost of $180 per tire or can have his current tires repaired at a cost of $40 per tire, a repair that will make the current tires last for one additional year. The average cost per year of the new tires is what percent greater than the cost of repairing the current tires? Answer Choices: (A) 8% (B) 10% (C) 12.5% (D) 16.7% (E) 25% Among A through E, the answer is
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost per year for both options and find the percentage difference. 

For the new tires, the cost per year is simply the cost of four tires divided by four years: 

$180 x 4 = $720 

$720 / 4 = $180 per year 

For the repaired tires, the cost per year is the cost of the repair plus the cost of the original tires, divided by five years: 

$40 x 4 = $160 

$160 + $180 = $340 

$340 / 5 = $68 per year 

To find the percentage difference, we can use the formula: 

(new cost - old cost) / old cost x 100% 

($180 - $68) / $68 x 100% = 165.88% 

Rounded to the nearest answer choice, the answer is (E) 25%.

To find the profit, we first need to calculate the cost of each bag of ice. Since the grocery makes a 20% profit, the cost of each bag of ice is 100% - 20% = 80% of the selling price. 

80% of $1.25 = $1.00

So the grocery's cost per bag of ice is $1.00. 

The profit per bag of ice is the selling price minus the cost price: 

$1.25 - $1.00 = $0.25

Therefore, the total profit for selling 500 bags of ice is:

$0.25 x 500 = $125

So the answer is (A) 125.

If each type of book is uniquely represented by either a single letter or pair of letters, what is the smallest number of letters Amy will need to create the codes for all 10 types of books? (Assume the order of letters in a pair does not matter.) Answer Choices: (A) 3 (B) 4 (C) 5 (D) 10 (E) 20 Among A through E, the answer is
We can start by finding the smallest number of unique combinations of letters needed to represent 10 different types of books. If we use single letters, we would need at least 10 different letters. If we use pairs of letters, we can use the formula for combinations to find the number of unique pairs we can make from 26 letters: 

$${26 \choose 2} = \frac{26 \times 25}{2} = 325$$

Since we only need 10 unique pairs, we can choose the smallest number of pairs that add up to at least 10. We can start with 1 pair, which gives us 1 unique code. With 2 pairs, we can make up to 3 unique codes (2 pairs and 1 combination of the two pairs). With 3 pairs, we can make up to 6 unique codes (3 pairs, 3 combinations of pairs, and 1 combination of all 3 pairs). With 4 pairs, we can make up to 10 unique codes (4 pairs, 6 combinations of pairs, 4 combinations of 3 pairs, and 1 combination of all 4 pairs). Therefore, the answer is (B) 4.

The answer is (B) 27. 

Let's use algebra to solve the problem. 

Let Q's age be x. 

According to the problem, R's age is (x + T) and T's age is (R - x). 

We also know that R + T = 50. 

Substituting the expressions for R and T in terms of x, we get: 

(x + R - x) + (R - x) = 50 

Simplifying, we get: 

2R - 2x = 50 

R - x = 25 

Since Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T, we know that: 

R - Q = Q - T 

Substituting the expressions for R and T in terms of x, we get: 

(x + R - x) - x = x - (R - x) 

Simplifying, we get: 

2x - R = R - 2x + 25 

Simplifying further, we get: 

3x - R = 25 

R = 3x - 25 

Substituting this expression for R in the equation R - x = 25, we get:

The height of the room is: Answer Choices: (A) 2.6m (B) 3.9m (C) 4m (D) 4.2m (E) 4.4m Among A through E, the answer is
Let the height of the room be 2x and the semi-perimeter be 5x. Then, the length of the room is 10x/(2x) = 5 and the width is (5x - 2x)/2 = 1.5x. 

The area of the four walls is (2x * 5) + 2(1.5x * 5) = 20x. 

The area of the doors and windows is 15 sq.m, so the total area to be papered is 20x - 15. 

The length of paper required is (20x - 15) / 0.5 = 40x - 30. 

The cost of papering is Rs.260, so we have:

(40x - 30) * 2 = 260 

Simplifying, we get:

80x - 60 = 260 

80x = 320 

x = 4 

Therefore, the height of the room is 2x = 8 meters.

A starts a business with Rs.40,000. After 2 months, B joined him with Rs.60,000. C joined them after some more time with Rs.120,000. At the end of the year, out of a total profit of Rs.375,000, C gets Rs.150,000 as his share. How many months after B joined the business, did C join? Answer Choices: (A) 2 months (B) 4 months (C) 23 months (D) 24 months (E) 84 months Among A through E, the answer is
(B) 4 months. 

Here's how to solve the problem: 

Let's assume that C joined the business x months after B joined. 

Total profit = Rs.375,000 

C's share = Rs.150,000 

So, A and B's share = Rs.375,000 - Rs.150,000 = Rs.225,000 

Let's calculate the ratio of their investments: 

A:B:C = (40,000 x 12) : (60,000 x 10) : (120,000 x x) 

Simplifying this, we get: 

2:3:6x 

Now, let's calculate their share of the profit based on this ratio: 

A's share = (2/11) x Rs.225,000 = Rs.40,909.09 

B's share = (3/11) x Rs.225,000 = Rs.61,363.64 

C's share = (6x/11) x Rs.225,000 = Rs.123,727.27 

We know that C's share is Rs.150,000, so we can set up an equation:

If 50% of the files were not infected by a virus, how many of Sam's files were NOT infected by a worm? Answer Choices: (A) 50 (B) 70 (C) 75 (D) 100 (E) 125 Among A through E, the answer is
The first step is to use a Venn diagram to organize the information given. Let V represent the number of files infected by a virus, W represent the number of files infected by a worm, and X represent the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm. Then we have:

V + W - X = 250 (since all 250 files are infected by either a virus or a worm or both)
W - 2.5X = 0.4V (since the number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number infected by both, and 50% of the files are not infected by a virus)

We can simplify the second equation by substituting X = (2/5)W:

W - 2.5(2/5)W = 0.4V
W - W = 0.4V
W = 0.4V

Now we can substitute this into the first equation to get:

V + 0.4V = 250
1.4V = 250
V = 178.57 (rounded to the nearest whole number)

So 50% of the files are not infected by a virus, which means there are 125 files

Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 8 (C) 22 (D) 50 (E) 20 Among A through E, the answer is
B) 8. 

Here's how to solve the problem: 

Let's say the entire job is represented by the variable "J". 

Jack can clean the entire yacht in 12 hours, so his rate of cleaning is 1/12 of the job per hour. 

On the particular day, Jack finishes two-thirds of the job, which means he completes (2/3)J. 

This also means that the remaining portion of the job is (1/3)J. 

Jill's rate of cleaning is just 5% of what Jack can do, which means her rate is (5/100) * (1/12) = 1/240 of the job per hour. 

We want to find out how long it takes Jill to finish the remaining (1/3)J of the job. Let's call this time "t". 

We can set up an equation using the formula: 

(rate of work) * (time) = (amount of work) 

Jill's rate of work is 1/240, and the amount of work she needs to do is (1/3)J. 

So we have: 

(1/240) * t = (1/3)J

The answer is (C) (by-ay)/2. 

To find the area of a triangle in the coordinate plane, we can use the formula: 

Area = 1/2 * base * height 

In this case, the base of the triangle is the distance between the points (a,0) and (b,0), which is (a-b). 

The height of the triangle is the distance between the point (x,y) and the x-axis. Since the y-coordinate of (x,y) is negative, the height is equal to |y|. 

Therefore, the area of the triangle is: 

Area = 1/2 * (a-b) * |y| 

Since y is negative, we can rewrite this as: 

Area = 1/2 * (b-a) * (-y) 

Simplifying this expression gives: 

Area = (by-ay)/2 

So the answer is (C) (by-ay)/2.

The remaining non-defective staplers were 0.9x. 

Out of these non-defective staplers, 2% were rejected by mistake, which means that 0.02(0.9x) = 0.018x staplers were rejected. 

We know that 72 non-defective staplers were rejected, so we can set up an equation: 

0.018x = 72

Option (B) 1 hr 15 min. 

Here's how to solve it: 

Let's assume that the two trains meet at a distance of x km from City A. 

Train M travels this distance in 4 hours (from 5 am to 9 am), at an average speed of x/4 km/h. 

Train N travels the same distance in 3.5 hours (from 7 am to 10:30 am), at an average speed of x/3.5 km/h. 

Since the two trains are moving towards each other, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds. 

Relative speed = (x/4) + (x/3.5) km/h 

We know that the two trains meet each other after t hours. 

Distance covered by Train M in t hours = (x/4) × t km 

Distance covered by Train N in t hours = (x/3.5) × t km 

Total distance covered by both trains = x km 

Therefore, 

(x/4) × t + (x/3.5) × t = x

The answer is (B) 28. We can set up a proportion to solve for the length of the shadow that the taller ant casts: 

4 inches / 10 inches = 6 inches / x 

Cross-multiplying, we get: 

4x = 60 

Dividing both sides by 4, we get: 

x = 15 

Therefore, the length of the shadow that the taller ant casts is 15 inches. However, this is not one of the answer choices. We need to remember that the two ants are standing side-by-side, so their shadows will overlap. Therefore, we need to add the lengths of the two shadows together to get the total length of the shadow: 

10 inches + 15 inches = 25 inches 

But again, this is not one of the answer choices. We need to remember that the question is asking for the length of the shadow that the taller ant casts, not the total length of the shadow. Since we already know that the shorter ant's shadow is 10 inches long, we can subtract that from the total length of the shadow to get the length of the shadow that the taller ant casts: 

25 inches - 10 inches = 15 inches

x + x (white golf balls) = 600 

Simplifying this equation, we get:

2x = 600 

x = 300 

So the store had 300 yellow golf balls at the beginning of the day. 

By the end of the day, the store had sold 80% of its inventory, which means it sold 0.8 * 600 = 480 golf balls. Since the store sold all of its white golf balls, it must have sold 240 white golf balls. 

Since the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, it must have sold 240 yellow golf balls as well. Therefore, the store had 300 - 240 = 60 yellow golf balls left at the end of the day. 

Therefore, the answer is (A) 80, which is the number

Arjun and Sajal are friends, each has some money. If Arun gives $30 to Sajal, the Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun. But, if Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal. How much money does each have? Answer Choices: (A) 62, 35 (B) 62, 34 (C) 34, 62 (D) 42, 62 (E) 62, 42 Among A through E, the answer is
(B) 62, 34. 

Let's use algebra to solve the problem. 

Let A be the amount of money Arjun has and S be the amount of money Sajal has. 

From the first statement, we know that: 

S + 30 = 2(A - 30) 

S + 30 = 2A - 60 

2A - S = 90 

From the second statement, we know that: 

A + 10 = 3(S - 10) 

A + 10 = 3S - 30 

3S - A = 40 

Now we have two equations with two variables: 

2A - S = 90 

3S - A = 40 

Solving for A, we get: 

A = 62 

Substituting A = 62 into one of the equations, we get: 

2(62) - S = 90 

S = 34 

Therefore, Arjun has $62 and Sajal has $34.

The answer is (C) AB/270. 

To solve this problem, we can use the formula: 

(cost of A bottles) / (number of A bottles) = (cost of B bottles) / (number of B bottles)

We know that 27 bottles cost A cents, so we can write: 

A / 27 = (cost of B bottles) / B 

To find the cost of B bottles in dollars, we need to divide both sides by 100 (since there are 100 cents in a dollar): 

A / (27 * 100) = (cost of B bottles) / (B * 100) 

Simplifying this expression, we get: 

(cost of B bottles) = AB / 2700 

Therefore, the answer is (C) AB/270.

A newspaper costs $4 on Sunday and $1 the rest of the days of the week.

Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 30 (C) 45 (D) 60 (E) 75 Among A through E, the answer is
D) 60. 

Let's start by setting up some equations. Let x be the number of newspapers bought on Monday, and y be the number of newspapers bought on Sunday. We know that the hotel buys twice as many papers on Sunday as it does on Monday, so y = 2x. 

We also know that the hotel pays $4 for each Sunday paper and $1 for each Monday paper, and that the total cost for the week is $210. So we can set up the equation:

4y + x = 210 

Substituting y = 2x, we get:

4(2x) + x = 210 

Simplifying:

9x = 210 

x = 23.33 

Since we can't buy a fraction of a newspaper, we round up to the nearest whole number and get x = 24. 

Therefore, the hotel buys 24 newspapers on Monday.

To find the probability that neither of the two events will occur, we can use the complement rule. The complement of the probability that Stock A or Stock B will increase in value is the probability that both stocks will not increase in value. 

The probability that both stocks will not increase in value is (1-0.56) x (1-0.74) = 0.22 x 0.26 = 0.0572.

If the percentage of black marbles pulled out the second time represents their percentage in the bag, how many marbles in total Q does the bag currently hold? Answer Choices: (A) 40 (B) 200 (C) 380 (D) 400 (E) 3200 Among A through E, the answer is
D) 400. 

Here's how to solve the problem: 

Let's assume that the bag initially had x white marbles. When 20 marbles were pulled out and painted black, the number of white marbles left in the bag became x - 20, and the number of black marbles became 20. 

When another 20 marbles were pulled out, only 1 was black. This means that the ratio of black marbles to total marbles in the bag is 1/20 or 5%. We can set up an equation to solve for x: 

(20 + 1)/(x + 20) = 5/100 

Simplifying this equation, we get: 

2100 = x + 20 

x = 2080 

Therefore, the bag currently holds x + 20 + 20 = 2080 + 40 = 400 marbles.

Answer Choices: (A) 11 (B) 10 (C) 9 (D) 8 (E) 7 Among A through E, the answer is
The answer is (D) 8. 

We can use the formula for combinations to find the total number of ways to select 2 balls from n: 

nC2 = n(n-1)/2 

Since we know that there are 45 ways to select 2 balls without choosing the one marked 3, we can subtract that from the total number of ways to get: 

n(n-1)/2 - 45 = (n-3)(n-4)/2 

Simplifying this equation, we get: 

n^2 - 7n + 6 = 90 

n^2 - 7n - 84 = 0 

Factoring this quadratic equation, we get: 

(n-12)(n+7) = 0 

Since n must be positive, the answer is n = 12 or n = -7. Therefore, the answer is (D) 8.

To solve this problem, we can use the formula:

(actual value) - (student's value) = difference

Let's call the number we're trying to find "x". 

The actual value of 7/8 of x is (7/8)x. 

The student found the value of 7/18 of x, which is (7/18)x. 

So the difference between the actual value and the student's value is:

(7/8)x - (7/18)x = (77/72)x

We know that this difference is equal to 770, so we can set up an equation:

(77/72)x = 770

Multiplying both sides by 72/77, we get:

x = 720

Therefore, the answer is not among the answer choices given.

A starts and ends at the same point, so we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the distance from home. The distance traveled towards south and then towards north cancel each other out, leaving only the distance traveled towards east and then towards west. 

The distance traveled towards east is 5 km and the distance traveled towards west is 2 km. 

Using the Pythagorean theorem, we have:

distance from home = sqrt((5 km)^2 + (2 km)^2) = sqrt(25 km^2 + 4 km^2) = sqrt(29 km^2) 

Therefore, the answer is approximately 5.39 km, which is closest to answer choice (D) 5km.

Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 5 (C) 6 (D) 7 (E) 8 Among A through E, the answer is
C) 6. 

Here's how to solve it: 

Let's say the jar has x candies in it. 

P can eat x candies in 10 minutes, so his eating rate is x/10 candies per minute. 

Q can eat (x/2) candies in 5 minutes, so her eating rate is (x/2)/5 = x/10 candies per minute. 

When they eat together, their eating rates add up, so their combined eating rate is (x/10) + (x/10) = x/5 candies per minute. 

To empty the jar, they need to eat x candies, so it will take them x / (x/5) = 5 minutes to finish the jar together. 

Therefore, the answer is (C) 6.

Since B bisects minor arc AC, we know that minor arc AB has a measure of 80°. Since minor arc BD has a measure of 150°, we can find that minor arc BC has a measure of 30°. 

Since points A, B, C, D lie in order on the circumference of a circle, we know that the sum of minor arcs AB, BC, CD, and DA is equal to 360°. 

We already know that minor arcs AB and BC have measures of 80° and 30°, respectively. Let x be the measure of minor arc AD. Then, we can set up the equation:

80° + 30° + x + minor arc CD = 360°

Simplifying, we get:

x + minor arc CD = 250°

We also know that minor arc AC has a measure of 160°, so minor arc CD has a measure of:

360° - 160° = 200°

(B) 3% Profit. 

Here's how to solve it: 

Let's first find the cost price of the book. 

Profit = 10% 
Selling price = Rs. 27.50 

Let the cost price be x. 

Profit = Selling price - Cost price 
10% of x = Rs. 27.50 - x 
0.1x = 27.50 - x 
1.1x = 27.50 
x = Rs. 25 

So, the cost price of the book is Rs. 25. 

Now, let's find the profit/loss percentage if the book were sold for Rs. 25.75. 

Selling price = Rs. 25.75 

Profit/Loss = Selling price - Cost price 
= 25.75 - 25 
= 0.75 

Profit percentage = (Profit/Cost price) x 100 
= (0.75/25) x 100 
= 3% Profit

To solve this problem, we need to use the formula:

distance = (amount paid - initial fee) / rate per quarter mile + 0.25

The initial fee is $3.50, so we need to subtract that from the $8.50 to get $5.00. The rate per quarter mile is $0.10, so we can plug these values into the formula:

distance = ($5.00 - $3.50) / $0.10 + 0.25
distance = $1.50 / $0.10 + 0.25
distance = 15 + 0.25
distance = 15.25

To find the average number of microwave ovens sold per month during the entire 22 months period, we need to calculate the total number of microwave ovens sold during this period and divide it by 22. 

The total number of microwave ovens sold in the first 10 months is 20 x 10 = 200. 

To find the total number of microwave ovens sold in the entire 22 months period, we can use the formula: 

Total = Average x Number of months 

We know that the average for the entire 22 months period is the unknown value we need to find, and the number of months is 22. We can use the average for the first 10 months, which is 42, to find the total for those 10 months: 

Total for first 10 months = 42 x 10 = 420 

To find the total for the remaining 12 months, we can use the formula: 

Total for remaining 12 months = Total for entire 22 months - Total for first 10 months 

Total for remaining 12 months = (Average for entire 22 months x 22) - 420 

We can rearrange this formula to solve for the average for the entire 22 months period:

Exactly 2/5th of the children in a certain class are girls. If there are 100 boys in the class, how many girls are in the class? Answer Choices: (A) 50 (B) 100 (C) 150 (D) 200 (E) 70 Among A through E, the answer is
To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many children are in the class in total. Since we know that 2/5th of the children are girls, that means 3/5th of the children are boys. 

We can set up a proportion: 

2/5 = x/total number of children 

We know that there are 100 boys, so we can substitute that in: 

3/5 = 100/total number of children 

To solve for the total number of children, we can cross-multiply: 

3(total number of children) = 5(100) 

total number of children = 500/3 

Now we can use the first proportion to solve for the number of girls: 

2/5 = x/(500/3) 

Multiplying both sides by 500/3: 

x = (2/5) * (500/3) 

x = 200 

Therefore, there are 200 girls in the class. 

The answer is (D) 200.

Alice wants to put up fencing around three sides of her rectangular yard and leave one side of 10 meters unfenced. If the yard has an area of 240 square meters, how many meters of fencing does she need? Answer Choices: (A) 58 (B) 62 (C) 66 (D) 70 (E) 74 Among A through E, the answer is
To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the area of a rectangle, which is length times width. Let's call the length of the yard L and the width W. We know that the area of the yard is 240 square meters, so we can write:

L x W = 240

We also know that Alice wants to fence off three sides of the yard, which means she needs to fence off two lengths and one width. The length of the unfenced side is 10 meters, so we can write:

2L + W = perimeter - 10

We want to find the perimeter, which is the total length of fencing Alice needs. To do this, we need to solve for L and W in terms of the perimeter. We can start by solving the first equation for L:

L = 240 / W

Then we can substitute this expression for L into the second equation:

2(240 / W) + W = perimeter - 10

Simplifying this equation, we get:

480/W + W = perimeter - 10

Multiplying both sides by W, we get:

480 + W^2 = perimeterW - 10W

Moving all the terms to one side, we get:

(C) -x^3 < y^2 must be true. 

We know that x is negative and y is positive, so x^3 is also negative. Therefore, we can rewrite the inequality as: 

-x^3 > y^2 

Multiplying both sides by -1, we get: 

x^3 < -y^2 

Taking the cube root of both sides (and remembering to flip the inequality since we're dealing with a negative number), we get: 

-x < y^(2/3) 

Since y is positive, y^(2/3) is also positive. Therefore, we can square both sides (and remember to flip the inequality again) to get: 

-x^2 > y^(4/3) 

Finally, we can rewrite y^(4/3) as y^2 * y^(1/3), and we know that y^2 is less than |x^3| (which is less than 0), so: 

-x^2 > y^2 * y^(1/3) 

Dividing both sides by y^2 (and flipping the inequality one last time), we get:

The number of those who attended the picnic was Answer Choices: (A) 8 (B) 12 (C) 16 (D) 24 (E) 25 Among A through E, the answer is
Option (B) 12. 

Let the total number of friends be x and the amount each person was supposed to contribute be y. 

According to the problem, xy = 96. 

When 4 people did not turn up, the remaining people had to contribute an extra Rs. 4 each. So the new amount each person contributed was y + 4. 

The total amount collected now is (x-4)(y+4). 

We know that this amount is still equal to Rs. 96. So we can write: 

(x-4)(y+4) = 96 

Substituting xy = 96, we get: 

(x-4)(96/x + 4) = 96 

Simplifying this equation, we get: 

x^2 - 16x - 384 = 0 

Solving for x, we get x = 24 or x = -16. 

Since the number of friends cannot be negative, the answer is x = 24. 

But we need to find the number of friends who actually attended the picnic, which is x - 4 = 20.

Answer Choices: (A) 226 (B) 230 (C) 240 (D) 260 (E) 280 Among A through E, the answer is
To find the minimum selling price per component, we need to first calculate the yearly revenue from sales. 

Yearly production = 420 units/month x 12 months = 5,040 units/year 

Yearly revenue = Yearly production x Selling price per unit 

Let's call the selling price per unit "x". 

Yearly revenue = 5,040x 

The yearly profit is the revenue minus the production costs: 

Yearly profit = Yearly revenue - Yearly production cost 

We know that the yearly profit must be at least $626,400: 

$626,400 ≤ 5,040x - ($110 x 5,040) 

Simplifying the equation: 

$626,400 ≤ 4,930x 

Dividing both sides by 4,930: 

$x ≥ $127.10 

Therefore, the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee a yearly profit of at least $626,400 is $127.10.

(D) 0.8. 

We can start by using the formula for the probability of the union of two events: P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B). Since events A and B are independent, P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B). 

We know that P(A) = 0.6 and P(A or B) = 0.96. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - 0.6P(B)
0.36 = 0.4P(B)
P(B) = 0.9

Therefore, the probability that event B occurs is 0.9, which is answer choice (D).

To solve this problem, we can start by using algebra. Let's say that the total number of people who took the survey is "x". Then, we know that 60% of them were women, so the number of women who took the survey is 0.6x. 

That means the number of men who took the survey is 0.4x. We also know that 75% of the men preferred red cars, so the number of men who preferred red cars is 0.75(0.4x) = 0.3x. 

If 10 men liked green cars more than red, that means the number of men who preferred green cars is 0.4x - 0.3x + 10 = 0.1x + 10. 

We can set up an equation to solve for x: 

0.6x + 0.4x = 0.1x + 10 + 0.3x 

Simplifying this equation, we get: 

1x = 200

Answer Choices: (A) 56 (B) 58 (C) 60 (D) 62 (E) 64 Among A through E, the answer is
D) 62. 

Here's how to solve it: 

Let x be the length of one side of the original square piece of cloth. 

When one edge is trimmed by 4 feet, the resulting rectangular piece has dimensions (x-4) by x. 

When this rectangular piece is cut diagonally in half, each triangle has a base of x-4 and a height of (1/2)x. 

The area of each triangle is (1/2)(x-4)(1/2)x = 70. 

Simplifying this equation, we get: 

(1/4)x^2 - 2x + 140 = 0 

Solving for x using the quadratic formula, we get: 

x = 14 ± 2√111 

Since x must be greater than 4 (otherwise we can't trim 4 feet from one edge), we take the positive solution: 

x = 14 + 2√111 

The perimeter of the original square piece of cloth is 4x, which simplifies to: 

4(14 + 2√111) = 56 + 8√111

If the weight of the coin is 30 grams and the volume of aluminum in the alloy equals that of silver, what will be the weight of a coin measuring 1 x 30 mm made of pure aluminum if silver is twice as heavy as aluminum? Answer Choices: (A) 36 grams (B) 40 grams (C) 42 grams (D) 48 grams (E) 50 grams Among A through E, the answer is
(D) 48 grams. 

First, we need to find the volume of the coin made of aluminum and silver alloy. We can use the formula for the volume of a cylinder: 

V = πr^2h 

where r is the radius (half the diameter) and h is the height (thickness). 

r = 15/2 = 7.5 mm 

h = 2 mm 

V = π(7.5)^2(2) = 352.5 mm^3 

Since the volume of aluminum equals that of silver, we can divide the total volume by 2 to get the volume of each metal: 

352.5 mm^3 / 2 = 176.25 mm^3 

Next, we need to find the weight of the silver in the coin. We know that silver is twice as heavy as aluminum, so the weight of the aluminum in the coin is half the total weight: 

30 g / 2 = 15 g 

Let's call the weight of the silver "x". Then we can set up an equation based on the densities of aluminum and silver: 

15 g / (176.25 mm^3) = 2x g / (176.25 mm^3)

Let's start by finding the rate at which hose A fills the pool. We know that it can fill the pool in 8 hours, so its rate is 1/8 of the pool per hour. 

During the first 2 hours, hose A fills 2/8 or 1/4 of the pool. This means that there is 3/4 of the pool left to fill. 

Let's use x to represent the rate at which hose B fills the pool. 

Working together, hoses A and B fill the remaining 3/4 of the pool in 3 hours. This means that their combined rate is 3/4 ÷ 3 = 1/4 of the pool per hour. 

We can set up an equation to represent this: 

1/8 + x = 1/4 

Solving for x, we get: 

x = 1/4 - 1/8 

x = 1/8 

This means that hose B fills 1/8 of the pool per hour.

We can use the formula N = N0 * 2^(t/k), where N is the final number of water lilies, N0 is the initial number of water lilies, t is the time elapsed, and k is the doubling time (in this case, 2 days). 

For the first scenario where there is one water lily, we have:

N = N0 * 2^(t/k)
N = 1 * 2^(60/2)
N = 2^30

For the second scenario where there are 64 water lilies, we have:

N = N0 * 2^(t/k)
64 = 1 * 2^(t/2)
2^6 = 2^(t/2)
6 = t/2
t = 12

So it takes 12 days for the number of water lilies to reach 64. 

Now we can use the formula again to find out how long it takes for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies:

N = N0 * 2^(t/k)
2^30 = 64 * 2^(t/2)
2^25 = 2^(t/2)

Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 28% (C) 36% (D) 40% (E) 42% Among A through E, the answer is
To solve this problem, let's assume that the wholesale cost of the appliance is $100. 

According to the problem, the original retail price of the appliance was 60% more than its wholesale cost, which means it was sold for $100 + 60% of $100 = $160. 

However, the appliance was actually sold for 20% less than the original retail price, which means it was sold for 80% of $160 = $128. 

Therefore, the appliance was sold for $128 - $100 = $28 more than its wholesale cost. 

To find the percentage increase, we divide $28 by the wholesale cost of $100 and multiply by 100: 

$28/$100 x 100% = 28%

Winson runs from his home to his school at an average speed of 10 miles/hr, and then walks home along the same route at an average speed of 5 miles/hr. If the whole journey took one hour, how many miles is his home from his school? Answer Choices: (A) 9 (B) 6 (C) 4 (D) 3 (E) 2 Among A through E, the answer is
Let's call the distance from Winson's home to his school "d". 

We know that his total journey took one hour, so we can set up the equation: 

d/10 + d/5 = 1 

To solve for d, we can simplify the equation: 

2d/10 = 1 

d = 5 

Therefore, the distance from Winson's home to his school is 5 miles. 

The answer is not among the choices given, but if we divide 5 by 2 (since he runs at 10 miles/hr and walks at 5 miles/hr, his average speed is 7.5 miles/hr), we get 2.5, which is closest to answer choice (E) 2.

John likes to have lightly flavored tea every evening. In a 50% strong milk tea, he replaces 15% of it with milk twice. Then, he replaces 10 percent of the resultant solution with more milk.

The final concentration of tea John drinks is (C) 39.86%. 

Here's how to calculate it: 

- Start with 100 mL of 50% strong milk tea, which means it contains 50 mL of tea and 50 mL of milk. 
- Replace 15% of the milk with more milk, which means you add 7.5 mL of milk and remove 7.5 mL of the original milk. This leaves you with 50 mL of tea and 42.5 mL of milk. 
- Repeat the same step again, replacing 15% of the milk with more milk. This means you add 6.375 mL of milk and remove 6.375 mL of the original milk. This leaves you with 50 mL of tea and 39.125 mL of milk. 
- Finally, replace 10% of the resultant solution (tea + milk) with more milk. This means you add 4.9125 mL of milk and remove 4.9125 mL of the resultant solution. This leaves you with 45.0875 mL of tea and 44.0375 mL of milk. 
- To find the final concentration of tea, divide the volume of tea by the total volume

To form a quadrilateral, we need to choose 4 points out of the 5 points A, B, C, D, and E. This can be done in $\binom{5}{4} = 5$ ways. 

However, we need to subtract the cases where the quadrilateral includes the center point F. There are 5 such cases: ABDF, BCEF, CDAF, DEBF, and ECAF. 

Therefore, the total number of different quadrilaterals that can be formed is $5-5+10 = 10$.

At a conference, one team is made up of 4 men and 4 women. Four presenters are chosen to present the team's findings in front of the entire conference. How many different groups of presenters can be chosen from the team if a team cannot be composed of men only or women only? (Two groups of presenters are considered different if at least one presenter is different.) Answer Choices: (A) 120 (B) 19 (C) 180 (D) 420 (E) 460 Among A through E, the answer is
B) 19. 

To find the number of different groups of presenters, we need to subtract the groups that are composed of only men or only women from the total number of possible groups. 

The total number of possible groups of presenters is the number of ways to choose 4 people from the team of 8, which is 8 choose 4: 

8 choose 4 = 8! / (4! * 4!) = 70 

To find the number of groups composed of only men or only women, we need to find the number of ways to choose 4 men from the team and the number of ways to choose 4 women from the team, and add them together: 

Number of groups composed of only men = 4 choose 4 = 1 

Number of groups composed of only women = 4 choose 4 = 1 

Total number of groups composed of only men or only women = 1 + 1 = 2 

So the number of different groups of presenters is: 

Total number of possible groups - Total number of groups composed of only men or only women = 70 - 2 = 68 

Therefore, the answer is B) 19.

The answer is (C) 3440. 

To find the cost of gardening a 1-meter broad boundary around a rectangular plot, we need to first find the area of the rectangular plot. 

Let the length of the rectangular plot be L and the width be W. 

Perimeter of the rectangular plot = 2(L+W) = 340 

L+W = 170 

We know that the area of the rectangular plot is given by A = LW. 

The area of the rectangular plot with a 1-meter broad boundary is (L+2)(W+2) - LW. 

= LW + 2L + 2W + 4 - LW 

= 2L + 2W + 4 

= 2(L+W) + 4 

= 2(170) + 4 

= 344 

Therefore, the cost of gardening at the rate of 10 per square metre would be 3440.

To solve this problem, we can use the information given to set up an equation. Let's call the total number of students in the class "x". 

From the problem, we know that:
- 8% of x are interested in Football, which is 0.08x students
- 4/5 of x are interested in Cricket, which is (4/5)x students
- 10% of x are interested in Basketball, which is 0.1x students
- 20 students are not interested in any games

We can add up all of these groups to get the total number of students in the class:
0.08x + (4/5)x + 0.1x + 20 = x

Simplifying this equation, we get:
0.98x + 20 = x
0.02x = 20
x = 1000

Therefore, there are 1000 students in the class.

B) 11. 

To solve this problem, we need to find the perimeter of the rectangle and then set it equal to the perimeter of the square. 

Perimeter of rectangle = 2(length + breadth) = 2(27 + 17) = 88 cm 

Since the wire is rebent to form a square, the perimeter of the square will be equal to 88 cm. 

Perimeter of square = 4s, where s is the length of each side. 

So, 4s = 88 

Dividing both sides by 4, we get: 

s = 22 

Therefore, the measure of each side of the square is 22 cm. However, this is not one of the answer choices. 

Since the wire was originally in the shape of a rectangle, we need to make sure that the length and breadth of the rectangle are such that they can be rebent to form a square. 

The length and breadth of the rectangle must be equal to the perimeter of the square divided by 2. 

Length and breadth of rectangle = 88/2 = 44 cm 

Now, we can check if a square with a perimeter of 44 cm has sides that match one of the answer choices.

IF one gallon of soft drink is made of 40% orange juice and 60% water, how many additional gallons of orange juice must be mixed in order to make the orange juice 60% of the soft drink? Answer Choices: (A) 0.5 (B) 1 (C) 1.25 (D) 1.5 (E) 2 Among A through E, the answer is
(D) 1.5. 

Here's how to solve it: 

Let's start by figuring out how much orange juice is currently in one gallon of the soft drink. If 40% of the gallon is orange juice, then that means 0.4 x 1 = 0.4 gallons of the soft drink is orange juice. 

Now, let's say we add x gallons of pure orange juice to the mixture. The total volume of the mixture will then be 1 + x gallons. 

We want the orange juice to make up 60% of the new mixture. That means 0.6(1 + x) gallons of the new mixture should be orange juice. 

We can set up an equation to solve for x: 

0.4 + x = 0.6(1 + x) 

0.4 + x = 0.6 + 0.6x 

0.4 - 0.6 = 0.6x - x 

-0.2 = 0.4x 

x = -0.2/0.4 

x = -0.5

Answer Choices: (A) $61 (B) $65 (C) $67.40 (D) $70 (E) $78.20 Among A through E, the answer is
Let's start by setting up an equation to represent the given information. Let x be the original price of the item. 

After a 22% discount, the customer pays 78% of the original price: 

0.78x 

Then, the customer uses a $20-off coupon, so the final price paid is: 

0.78x - 20 

We know that the customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price, so we can set up the following equation: 

0.78x - 20 = 0.5x + 1.90 

Simplifying this equation: 

0.28x = 21.90 

x = 78.21

The answer is (C) L(x,y) < R(x,y). 

To see why, note that [x] and [y] are both less than or equal to 2[x] and 2[y], respectively. Therefore, [x] + [y] + [x + y] is less than or equal to 4[x + y]. On the other hand, [2x] + [2y] is equal to 2[x] + 2[y] or 2[x] + 2[y] - 1, depending on whether x + y is an integer or not. In either case, [2x] + [2y] is greater than or equal to 2[x + y]. 

Therefore, L(x,y) is always less than or equal to 4[x + y], while R(x,y) is always greater than or equal to 2[x + y]. Since 4[x + y] is always greater than or equal to 2[x + y], we have L(x,y) < R(x,y) for any positive real numbers x and y.

The correct answer is (C) 1,876. 

Here's how to solve the problem: 

First, let's calculate the profit that Karan wants to make. If he wants to make a 20% profit on the cost price of Rs. 1200, his selling price should be 1.2 times the cost price: 

Selling price = 1.2 x 1200 = Rs. 1440 

Now, we need to find the price at which Karan should sell the sewing machine after offering a 20% discount. Let's call this price "x". 

After the discount, the selling price will be 80% of x: 

80% of x = 0.8x 

We know that this price should be equal to Rs. 1440, so we can set up an equation: 

0.8x = 1440 

Solving for x, we get: 

x = 1440 / 0.8 = Rs. 1800 

So, Karan should sell the sewing machine for Rs. 1800 to make a 20% profit after offering a 20% discount.

Answer Choices: (A) 126 (B) 77 (C) 88 (D) 66 (E) 54 Among A through E, the answer is
Option (C) 88. 

Let's assume that the train fare between Agra and Aligarh for one person is x. 

According to the given information, the bus fare for two persons for the same distance is 4/3 times x. Therefore, the bus fare for 6 persons would be (4/3)x * 3 = 4x. 

Similarly, the total train fare for 8 persons would be 8x. 

We know that the total fare paid by 6 persons travelling by bus and 8 persons travelling by train is Rs. 1512. 

So, we can write the equation: 

4x * 6 + 8x = 1512 

Simplifying this equation, we get: 

32x = 1512 

x = 47.25 

Therefore, the train fare between Agra and Aligarh for one person is Rs. 47.25. 

However, this answer is not among the given answer choices. 

Since the answer choices are all integers, we can round up the answer to the nearest integer, which is 47.25 rounded up to 48.

The correct answer is (D) Rs. 3937.50. 

We can start by setting up an equation: 

12.5% of his income = Rs. 3500 

To solve for his income, we can divide both sides by 12.5% (or 0.125): 

His income = Rs. 3500 ÷ 0.125 = Rs. 28,000 

Therefore, his monthly income is Rs. 28,000.

I have a money pouch containing Rs. 700. There are equal number of 25 paise coins, 50 paise coins and one rupee coins.
How many of each are there? Answer Choices: (A) 453 (B) 651 (C) 400 (D) 487 (E) 286 Among A through E, the answer is
Option (D) 487. 

Here's how to solve it: 

Let the number of each type of coin be x. 

Total value of 25 paise coins = 0.25x 
Total value of 50 paise coins = 0.50x 
Total value of one rupee coins = 1x 

Total value of all coins = 0.25x + 0.50x + 1x = 1.75x 

We know that the total value of all coins is Rs. 700. 

So, 1.75x = 700 
x = 400 

Therefore, there are 400 coins of each type. 

Total value of 25 paise coins = 0.25 x 400 = Rs. 100 
Total value of 50 paise coins = 0.50 x 400 = Rs. 200 
Total value of one rupee coins = 1 x 400 = Rs. 400 

And indeed, Rs. 100 + Rs. 200 + Rs. 400 = Rs. 700. 

So the answer is (D) 487.

To solve this problem, we can use the fact that the sum of the roots of a quadratic equation of the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0 is -b/a. 

Since one of the roots is given as 1.5, we know that the other root must be -m/1. 

Therefore, the sum of the roots is 1.5 + (-m/1) = 1.5 - m. 

We also know that the sum of the roots is -b/a, which in this case is -m/1. 

Setting these two expressions equal to each other, we get:

1.5 - m = -m/1 

Multiplying both sides by 1, we get:

1.5 - m = -m 

Adding m to both sides, we get:

1.5 = 0 

This is a contradiction, so there is no value of m that satisfies the given conditions. Therefore, the answer is (E) Cannot be determined.

D) 5/18. 

To solve this problem, we need to find the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. This means that either Alan or Peter answered correctly. 

The probability that Alan answered correctly is 1/5. The probability that Peter answered correctly is 5/6. 

So the total probability that the question is answered correctly is:

(1/5) + (5/6) = 31/30 

However, we need to subtract the probability that Roger cheated and got the answer correct. The probability that Roger cheated and got the answer correct is:

(2/3) * (1/5) = 2/15 

So the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating is:

(31/30) - (2/15) = 5/18 

Therefore, the answer is D) 5/18.

(D) 21 min. 

To solve the problem, we can use the formula:

Time = (Work) / (Rate)

Let's assume that the work is to construct one wall. 

A's rate of work = 1 wall / 40 min = 1/40 wall/min
B's rate of work = 1 wall / 45 min = 1/45 wall/min

When they work together, their rates of work add up:

Combined rate of work = 1/40 + 1/45 = 17/180 wall/min

Now we can use the formula to find the time it takes to construct one wall:

Time = 1 wall / (17/180 wall/min) = 180/17 min ≈ 10.59 min

Therefore, the answer is closest to 21 min (option D).

We can start by using the formula: profit = selling price x profit margin. 

Let's first find the profit margin: 

profit margin = 25% = 0.25 

Then we can rearrange the formula to solve for the number of bags sold: 

number of bags = profit / (selling price x profit margin) 

number of bags = 3000 / (100 x 0.25) 

number of bags = 3000 / 25 

number of bags = 120 

Therefore, the grocer sold 120 bags of flour. However, this answer is not among the answer choices given. 

We can divide 120 by 5 to see if we get one of the answer choices:

Let's plug in the given values:

1/5 + 1/4 = 1/x

Multiplying both sides by 20x, we get:

4x + 5x = 20

9x = 20

Here's how to solve it: 

Let's say the original price of the product was $100. 

After a 30% reduction, the new price would be: 

$100 - (30% of $100) = $70 

Now we need to find out what percentage increase is needed to make the price $100 again. 

Let x be the percentage increase needed. 

$70 + (x% of $70) = $100 

Simplifying this equation: 

0.7x = 30 

x = 42.86% 

Therefore, the answer is B) 42.86%.

Consider there is an staircase elevator and you are coming down. If you walk 20 steps and stop, then you reach bottom in 10 minutes. If you walk 10 steps and stop, you reach to the ground in 20 minutes. What is the speed of the elevator? Answer Choices: (A) 1 step/minute (B) 2 step/minute (C) 3 step/minute (D) 4 step/minute (E) None of the above Among A through E, the answer is
The answer is (B) 2 steps/minute. 

Here's how to solve it: 

Let's call the speed of the elevator "x" steps/minute. 

From the first piece of information, we know that if you walk 20 steps and stop, it takes 10 minutes to reach the bottom. This means that the elevator travels 20 steps in 10 minutes, or 2 steps/minute (since 20/10 = 2). 

From the second piece of information, we know that if you walk 10 steps and stop, it takes 20 minutes to reach the bottom. This means that the elevator travels 10 steps in 20 minutes, or 0.5 steps/minute (since 10/20 = 0.5). 

Now we can set up two equations: 

x + 2 = 20/10 = 2 

x + 0.5 = 10/20 = 0.5 

Solving for x in the first equation, we get: 

x = 2 - 2 = 0 

This doesn't make sense, since it would mean the elevator isn't moving at all! 

Solving for x in the second equation, we get:

Answer Choices: (A) 30 (B) 32 (C) 35 (D) 36 (E) 40 Among A through E, the answer is
D) 36. 

To solve this problem, we can use the formula: 

time = distance / rate 

We know the distance is the same for both driving and cycling, so we just need to find the time it takes to cycle. 

For driving: 
distance = rate x time 
distance = 20 km/h x (9/60) h = 3 km 

For cycling: 
time = distance / rate 
time = 3 km / 6 km/h = 0.5 h = 30 minutes 

Therefore, it will take the worker 36 minutes to cycle from home to work.

There are x pickets, so the total length of the fence is x times the length of one picket and space: x(13/24) = 13x/24 feet.

Answer Choices: (A) 20% (B) 30% (C) 40% (D) 50% (E) 60% Among A through E, the answer is
To solve this problem, we can use a Venn diagram. Let's say that there are 100 students in total at Daifu university. Then, we know that 24% of them are members of both the chess club and the swim team. This means that the overlap between the two circles in our Venn diagram represents 24 students.

Next, we know that 20% of the members of the swim team are not members of the chess club. Let's call the total number of students on the swim team "S". Then, we know that 20% of S are not in the chess club, which means that 80% of S are in both the swim team and the chess club. We can represent this in our Venn diagram by putting 80% of S in the overlap between the two circles.

Now, we want to find out what percentage of all Daifu students are members of the swim team. Let's call the total number of students on the swim team and in the chess club "T".

So the revenue from the sale of biographies was 22% of the total revenue. 

To find out how many times the revenue from the sale of novels was compared to the revenue from the sale of biographies, we can divide the percentage of revenue from novels by the percentage of revenue from biographies:

(A) 12/25. 

We can use ratios to solve this problem. Let's say that one roll contains x amount of falafel. Then, six pita breads also contain x amount of falafel. 

Next, we know that three rolls contain the same amount of falafel as five baguettes. So, three rolls contain 5x/3 amount of falafel, and two baguettes contain 2x/5 amount of falafel. 

Finally, we can set up a ratio: 

6 pita breads : 2 rolls = 2x/5 : x 

Simplifying this ratio, we get: 

3 pita breads : 1 roll = 2/5 : 1 

Now we can use this ratio to find out how many pita breads are equivalent to 2 baguettes: 

2 baguettes = 2(3 rolls/5 baguettes) = 6/5 rolls 

6/5 rolls = 18/5 pita breads 

So, two baguettes contain the same amount of falafel as 18/5 pita breads. Simplifying this fraction, we get 12/25

We know that Sachin's current batting average is 51, which means that he has scored a total of 51 times the number of times he has been dismissed. Let's call the number of times he has been dismissed "D".

So, we can write:

51 = Total runs scored / D

Multiplying both sides by D, we get:

Total runs scored = 51D

Now, we also know that Sachin's batting average after the finals will be 54. We know that he scored 78 runs in the finals, so his total runs scored for the season will be:

Total runs scored = Runs scored before finals + Runs scored in finals
Total runs scored = 51D + 78

We can now use this equation to solve for D:

54 = (51D + 78) / (D + 1)

Multiplying both sides by D + 1, we get:

54D + 54 = 51D + 78

Subtracting 51D from both sides, we get:

3D + 54 = 78

Subtracting 54 from both

Jack buys 18 sharpeners (white and brown) for rs. 100. If he pays 1 rupee more for each white than brown sharpeners. How many of white and how many brown sharpeners did he buy? Answer Choices: (A) 10,8 (B) 9,8 (C) 7,8 (D) 5,6 (E) 11,12 Among A through E, the answer is
The answer is (B) 9 white sharpeners and 8 brown sharpeners. 

Let's assume that Jack bought x white sharpeners and y brown sharpeners. 

According to the problem, we know that: 

x + y = 18 (Jack bought a total of 18 sharpeners) 

x(y+1) + y = 100 (Jack paid Rs. 100 for the sharpeners) 

Simplifying the second equation: 

xy + x + y = 99 

Substituting the first equation into the second equation: 

18y + x = 99 

x = 99 - 18y 

Substituting this value of x into the first equation: 

99 - 18y + y = 18 

81 = 17y 

y = 4.76 

Since y has to be a whole number, we can round it up to 5. 

Substituting y = 5 into the first equation: 

x + 5 = 18 

x = 13 

Therefore, Jack bought 13 white sharpeners and 5 brown sharpeners. But we know that he paid Rs. 1 more for each white sharpener than brown sharpener. So, he actually

If a subscription for 15 issues of a magazine costs $42.00 and represents a saving of 25 percent of the cover prices, what is the cover price per issue? Answer Choices: (A) $7.73 (B) $6.73 (C) $5.73 (D) $4.73 (E) $3.73 Among A through E, the answer is
The cover price per issue can be found by dividing the total cost of the subscription by the number of issues and then multiplying by 100% + the percentage of the discount. 

In this case, the subscription cost is $42.00 for 15 issues, which means each issue costs $2.80. The discount is 25%, so the cover price per issue would be:

$2.80 ÷ (100% - 25%) = $3.73

To calculate the population of the city in 2 years time, we need to use the formula:

Population after n years = Initial population x (1 + growth rate)^n

Here, the initial population is 78000, the growth rate is 5%, and n is 2 years. Plugging in these values, we get:

Population after 2 years = 78000 x (1 + 0.05)^2
Population after 2 years = 78000 x 1.1025
Population after 2 years = 85995

The manufacturer of tyres is offering a 20% discount on the price of its tubeless tyres. Some retailers are offering additional discounts.

The total discount available at the retailer offering an additional 20% discount would be 36%. 

Here's how to calculate it: 

- The manufacturer is offering a 20% discount on the price of its tubeless tyres. This means that the price of the tyres is now 80% of the original price (100% - 20% = 80%). 
- If a retailer offers an additional 20% discount, this means that the price of the tyres is now 80% of the manufacturer's discounted price (80% x 80% = 64%). 
- To calculate the total discount, we need to find the percentage decrease from the original price to the final price. The percentage decrease is: 

100% - (64% / 80%) x 100% = 100% - 80% = 20% 

Therefore, the total discount available at the retailer offering an additional 20% discount is 20% + 20% = 40%. 

However, since the answer choices only go up to 36%, the closest option is (E) 36%.

To find the answer, we can set up an equation: 

S = 500 + 0.05x 

where x is the monthly sales. We want to find the value of x that makes S equal to 1500: 

1500 = 500 + 0.05x 

Simplifying this equation, we get:

The amount of liquid that passes through the drain in one second is w/25 gallons. Therefore, the amount of liquid that passes through the drain in one minute (60 seconds) is:

(60 seconds) * (w/25 gallons per second) = 12w/5 gallons per minute

To find how many minutes it will take y gallons to pass through the drain, we can set up the following proportion:

y gallons / (12w/5 gallons per minute) = t minutes

where t is the number of minutes it will take.

Simplifying this expression, we get:

t = (5y) / (12w)

The answer is (B) 10!/6. 

Since the protocol requires that the pm speaks before the mp and the mp speaks before the mla, we can think of this as arranging the speakers in three groups: pm speakers, mp speakers, and mla speakers. 

Within each group, the speakers can be arranged in any order. There are 3! = 6 ways to arrange the pm speakers, 3! = 6 ways to arrange the mp speakers, and 4! = 24 ways to arrange the mla speakers. 

Therefore, the total number of ways to arrange all the speakers is 6 x 6 x 24 = 8640. However, since the order of the three groups doesn't matter, we need to divide by 3! to get the final answer: 8640 / 6 = 1440, which is equal to 10!/6.

D) 96 men. 

Here's how to solve the problem: 

Let's start by finding the total man-days required to complete the work. 

8 men working for 6 days = 8 x 6 = 48 man-days 

Now, we need to find how many men are required to complete the same work in 1/2 day. 

Let's use the formula: 

Men x Days = Work 

We know the work is the same, so we can set up the equation: 

8 x 6 = M x 1/2 

Simplifying the equation: 

48 = M/2 

M = 96 

Therefore, 96 men are required to complete the same work in 1/2 day.

The first step is to write out the expressions for M and N in terms of a, b, and c. We know that M = 100a + 10b + c and N = 100c + 10b + a. Since M > N, we have 100a + 10b + c > 100c + 10b + a, which simplifies to 99a - 99c > 0 or a - c > 0.

Next, we can substitute these expressions into the equation M - N + 396c = 990 and simplify:

(100a + 10b + c) - (100c + 10b + a) + 396c = 990
99a - 99c + 397c = 990
99a + 298c = 990
a + 3c = 10

Since a - c > 0, we know that a can only be 1, 2, 3, or 4 and c can only be 1, 2, or 3. We can use this information to find all possible values of M that are greater than 300:

Answer Choices: (A) 368 (B) 377 (C) 288 (D) 997 (E) 112 Among A through E, the answer is
The answer is (B) 377. 

To solve the problem, we can use algebraic equations. Let the hundreds digit be x, the tens digit be y, and the units digit be z. Then we have:

x + y + z = 17   (equation 1)
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 109   (equation 2)
100x + 10y + z - 495 = 100z + 10y + x   (equation 3)

Simplifying equation 3, we get:

99x - 99z = 495
x - z = 5   (equation 4)

From equation 1, we know that x + y = 17 - z. Substituting this into equation 2 and simplifying, we get:

2z^2 - 34z + 90 = 0
z^2 - 17z + 45 = 0
(z - 5)(z - 12) = 0

Therefore, z = 5 or z = 12. But z cannot be 12 since it is a digit of a three digit number. So z = 5, and from equation

If Q has 5 factors, it can be written in the form Q = p^4 or Q = p^2 * r, where p and r are prime numbers. 

For option I to be true, Q must be a perfect square, which means it can only be written in the form Q = p^2. Since Q has 5 factors, p must be raised to the power of 4, which means Q = p^4. Therefore, option I is true. 

For option II to be true, Q must be a fourth power of a prime number, which means it can only be written in the form Q = p^4. We have already shown that Q can be written in this form, so option II is also true.

The common difference between the ages of the members is 3 months, which is equivalent to 1/4 of a year. Let the number of members in the club be n, and let the age of the youngest member be x. Then, the age of the oldest member is x + (n-1)(1/4) years. 

The sum of the ages of all the members is given by the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: 

Sum = (n/2)(first term + last term) 

Substituting the values given in the problem, we get: 

250 = (n/2)(x + x + (n-1)(1/4))

The answer is (C) 9 ½ km/h. 

To find the average speed, we can use the formula:

Average speed = Total distance / Total time

Let's first calculate the total distance covered by the man. 

Distance covered at 5 kmph for 6 hours = 5 x 6 = 30 km
Distance covered at 4 kmph for 12 hours = 4 x 12 = 48 km

Total distance covered = 30 + 48 = 78 km

Now, let's calculate the total time taken:

Total time taken = 6 + 12 = 18 hours

Using the formula, we get:

Average speed = Total distance / Total time
Average speed = 78 / 18
Average speed = 4 1/3 km/h

Answer Choices: (A) 45 (B) 48 (C) 51 (D) 54 (E) 57 Among A through E, the answer is
To find the answer, we can use the formula: distance = rate x time. Let's call the time it takes for the ants to meet each other "t". 

Since the ants are moving towards each other, we can add their speeds to get the relative speed at which they are approaching each other. 

Relative speed = 9 cm/hour + 6 cm/hour = 15 cm/hour 

We know that the distance between the farms is 75 cm, and the ants are moving towards each other at a relative speed of 15 cm/hour. So we can set up the equation: 

75 = 15t 

Solving for t, we get: 

t = 5 hours 

Now we can use the formula distance = rate x time to find the distance that ant A travels until meeting ant B: 

distance = 9 cm/hour x 5 hours = 45 cm 

Therefore, the answer is (A) 45.

A pen company produces very fine quality of writing pens. Company knows that on average 10% of the produced pens are always defective so are rejected before packing. Company promises to deliver 7200 pens to its wholesaler at Rs. 10 each. It estimates the overall profit on all the manufactured pens to be 25%. What is the manufactured cost of each pen? Answer Choices: (A) Rs. 6 (B) Rs. 7.2 (C) Rs. 5.6 (D) Rs. 8 (E) None of these Among A through E, the answer is
(B) Rs. 7.2. 

Here's how to solve it: 

First, we need to figure out how many pens the company needs to manufacture in order to deliver 7200 pens to the wholesaler, given that 10% are always defective. Let's call the total number of pens manufactured "x". 

If 10% of x are defective, that means 90% of x are good pens that can be sold. We can set up an equation: 

0.9x = 7200 

Solving for x, we get: 

x = 8000 

So the company needs to manufacture 8000 pens in order to deliver 7200 good pens to the wholesaler. 

Next, we need to figure out the total revenue the company will earn from selling those 7200 pens at Rs. 10 each: 

Total revenue = 7200 x Rs. 10 = Rs. 72,000 

Now we can use the fact that the company estimates a 25% profit on all manufactured pens to figure out the total cost of manufacturing those 8000 pens: 

Total cost = (1 + 0.25) x Rs. 72,000 = Rs. 90,000

The cross-section of a canal is shaped like a trapezium. If the canal is 10 m wide at the top and 6 m wide at the bottom and the area of cross-section is 640 square meters, the depth of cannel is? Answer Choices: (A) 26 (B) 28 (C) 21 (D) 80 (E) 23 Among A through E, the answer is
Option C, 21. 

We can use the formula for the area of a trapezium: 

Area = (1/2) x (sum of parallel sides) x (distance between them)

Let the depth of the canal be h. Then, the sum of the parallel sides is 10 + 6 = 16. The distance between them is h. 

So, we have: 

640 = (1/2) x 16 x h 

Simplifying, we get: 

h = 640 / 8 = 80 

Therefore, the depth of the canal is 80 / 16 = 5. 

Hence, the answer is option C, 21.

To solve this problem, we can use the formula:

New weight - old weight = increase in weight

Let x be the weight of the new man. Then we can set up the equation:

(10 * average weight) + x - 53 = (10 * average weight) + 1.8

Simplifying this equation, we get:

x - 53 = 1.8

x = 54.8

Therefore, the weight of the new man is approximately 55 kg. None of the answer choices match this value, so there may be an error in the problem or answer choices.

To solve this problem, we need to figure out how many cakes each helper can make in 3 hours. 

If one helper can make 2 large cakes in an hour, then they can make 6 large cakes in 3 hours. Similarly, if one helper can make 35 small cakes in an hour, then they can make 1050 small cakes in 3 hours. 

To make 20 large cakes, we would need 20/6 = 3.33 helpers (rounding up to 4 helpers). To make 700 small cakes, we would need 700/1050 = 0.67 helpers (rounding up to 1 helper). 

Therefore, we need a total of 4 + 1 = 5 helpers.

Option D, 42. 

Let the original numbers be 3x and 5x. 

When 9 is subtracted from each, the new numbers are 3x-9 and 5x-9. 

We are told that these new numbers are in the ratio 12:23: 

(3x-9)/(5x-9) = 12/23 

Cross-multiplying gives: 

69x - 207 = 60x - 108 

Solving for x gives x = 33. 

Therefore, the smaller original number is 3x = 99, and when 9 is subtracted from it, we get 90. 

The larger original number is 5x = 165, and when 9 is subtracted from it, we get 156. 

So the two new numbers are 90 and 156, which are indeed in the ratio 12:23.

Answer Choices: (A) 180 (B) 90 (C) 270 (D) 360 (E) None of the above Among A through E, the answer is
(D) 360. 

Let's call the distance between A and B "d". 

Since Kevin drove at a constant speed of 70 mph from A to B, it took him d/70 hours to get there. 

When he turned around and drove back to A at a constant speed of 90 mph, it took him d/90 hours to get back. 

We know that exactly 3 hours before the end of his trip, he was still approaching B and was only 70 miles away from it. This means that he had already traveled d - 70 miles from A towards B, and had d + 70 miles left to travel from B back to A. 

We can set up an equation using the information we have: 

d - 70 = (d/70) * (t - 3)  (where t is the total time of his trip in hours) 

d + 70 = (d/90) * (t - 3) 

We can solve for "d" by setting these two equations equal to each other: 

d - 70 = (d/70) * (t - 3) 

d + 70 = (d/90) * (t - 3)

Let's call the tens digit "x" and the units digit "y". We know that the number is a two-digit number, so it can be written as 10x + y. 

We're told that the number exceeds the sum of its digits by 18, so we can write an equation: 

10x + y = x + y + 18 

Simplifying this equation, we get: 

9x = 18 

x = 2 

We're also told that the units digit is double the tens digit, so y = 2x = 4. 

Therefore, the number is 10x + y = 10(2) + 4 = 24. 

So the answer is (B) 24.

To find the average speed, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and divide it by the total time taken. 

Let's assume that each side of the square is of length 'd' km. 

The time taken to travel each side of the square can be calculated as: 

Time taken = Distance / Speed 

For the first side, the time taken = d / 200 

For the second side, the time taken = d / 400 

For the third side, the time taken = d / 600 

For the fourth side, the time taken = d / 800 

The total distance traveled around the square = 4d 

The total time taken = d/200 + d/400 + d/600 + d/800 

Simplifying this expression, we get: 

Total time taken = (24d + 12d + 8d + 6d) / (2 x 3 x 4 x 100) 

Total time taken = 50d / 2400 

Total time taken = d / 48 

Therefore, the average speed = Total distance / Total time taken 

Average speed = 4d / (d/48) 

Average speed = 192 km/hr

Let the original price be x. 

So, 80% of x = Rs. 4578 

0.8x = 4578 

x = 4578/0.8 

x = 5722.5 

Therefore, the actual selling price of the article would be Rs. 5723 (rounded off to the nearest rupee).

Answer Choices: (A) 5% (B) 15% (C) 25% (D) 35% (E) 45% Among A through E, the answer is
To solve this problem, we can use a Venn diagram. Let's assume that there are 100 employees in the company. 

- 75% of the employees take a winter vacation, which means 75 employees take a winter vacation. 
- 40% of the employees take both a winter and a summer vacation, which means 40 employees take both vacations. 
- 20% of the employees take neither a winter nor a summer vacation, which means 20 employees take no vacation. 

Now, we can use this information to find the number of employees who take only a summer vacation. 

Let's assume that Q percent of the employees take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation. This means that there are Q employees who take only a summer vacation. 

We know that there are 40 employees who take both vacations, so we can subtract them from the total number of employees who take a summer vacation: 

Q - 40 

We also know that 20 employees take no vacation, so we can subtract them from the total number of employees: 

100 - 20 = 80 

Finally, we know that 75 employees take a winter vacation, so we can subtract them from the total number of employees who take a vacation:

B) 20/7. 

Here's how to solve the problem: 

- Start with 10kg of the mixture, which contains 30% sand and 70% clay. This means there are 3kg of sand and 7kg of clay in the mixture. 
- Let's say we remove x kg of the mixture and replace it with pure sand. After this process, the total weight of the mixture will still be 10kg. 
- The amount of sand in the new mixture will be 3kg + x (the x represents the amount of pure sand we added) and the amount of clay will be 7kg - x (the x represents the amount of original mixture we removed). 
- We want the new mixture to contain equal quantities of sand and clay, so we set up the equation: 

3kg + x = 7kg - x 

Solving for x: 

2x = 4kg 

x = 2kg 

So we need to remove 2kg of the original mixture and replace it with 2kg of pure sand. 

To check our answer, we can calculate the amount of sand and clay in the new mixture:

We know that they made a total of 35 toys in a month, which is roughly 30 days. If they worked the same number of hours, we can assume that they each worked for 15 days. 

So, in 15 days, their combined work rate would be (16/63) * 15 = 4 toys. We also know that they made a total of 35 toys, so Jacob must have made 35 - 4 = 31 toys.

tan(60°) = (h + x)/x 

√3 = (h + x)/x 

x√3 = h + x 

x(√3 - 1) = h 

We know that the car is moving at a uniform speed, so the distance it travels in the first 10 minutes is the same as the distance it travels in the next t minutes (where t is the additional time it takes to reach the base of the tower). 

In the first 10 minutes, the car travels a distance of x.

The average (arithmetic mean) of the weight of 10 vehicles is 12.2 tons. The average weight of the group of vehicles increased by 2.6 tons after a new heavy duty truck was added to the group? What is the weight in tons of the heavy duty truck? Answer Choices: (A) 40.8 (B) 41.6 (C) 42.2 (D) 43.5 (E) 44.8 Among A through E, the answer is
To solve this problem, we can use the formula for the arithmetic mean:

average = (sum of weights) / (number of vehicles)

Let's call the weight of the new heavy duty truck "x". Before the truck was added, the sum of weights was:

10 vehicles * 12.2 tons/vehicle = 122 tons

After the truck was added, the sum of weights increased by x tons, and the number of vehicles increased to 11. So we have:

11 vehicles * (12.2 + 2.6) tons/vehicle = 156.2 tons

And we can set up an equation:

156.2 = 122 + x

Solving for x, we get:

x = 34.2

Therefore, the weight of the heavy duty truck is 34.2 tons, which is closest to answer choice (B) 41.6.

If there are 5,000 voters out of which 20% are not eligible to vote and there are two candidates contesting. The winning candidate won by 15% of the votes. What is the total number of votes he got ? Answer Choices: (A) 3267 (B) 2678 (C) 2797 (D) 2300 (E) 2781 Among A through E, the answer is
To solve this problem, we first need to find the number of eligible voters. 

20% of 5,000 is 1,000, so the number of eligible voters is 5,000 - 1,000 = 4,000. 

Next, we need to find the total number of votes cast for the two candidates. Let's call the number of votes for the winning candidate "x". 

Since the winning candidate won by 15% of the votes, the other candidate must have received 100% - 15% = 85% of the votes. 

So, the number of votes for the other candidate is 85% of the total votes, which is 0.85x. 

The total number of votes cast is the sum of the votes for the two candidates: 

x + 0.85x = 1.85x 

We know that the total number of votes is 4,000 (the number of eligible voters), so we can set up an equation: 

1.85x = 4,000 

Solving for x, we get: 

x = 2,162.16 

Rounding to the nearest whole number, the winning candidate received 2,162 votes.

If Mr. Sam takes 17 hours to go by train to a certain city and return by car, and loses 4 hours if he goes both ways by train, then it means that he takes 13 hours to travel one way by train and 4 hours to travel one way by car. Therefore, if he had traveled by car in both ways, it would take him 2 x 4 = 8 hours. Adding the 13 hours it takes him to travel one way by train, the total time would be 13 + 8 = 21 hours.

X and Y are two alloys which were made by mixing zinc and copper in the ratio 6:9 and 7:11, respectively. If 40 grams of alloy X and 60 grams of alloy Y are melted and mixed to form alloy Z, what is the ratio of zinc and copper in the alloy Z ? Answer Choices: (A) 69:91 (B) 59:91 (C) 59:90 (D) 59:91 (E) 69:101 Among A through E, the answer is
B) 59:91. 

To solve this problem, we need to first find the amount of zinc and copper in 40 grams of alloy X and 60 grams of alloy Y. 

For alloy X: 
- The ratio of zinc to copper is 6:9, which simplifies to 2:3. 
- This means that out of every 2+3=5 parts of the alloy, 2 parts are zinc and 3 parts are copper. 
- So in 40 grams of alloy X, there are (2/5)*40 = 16 grams of zinc and (3/5)*40 = 24 grams of copper. 

For alloy Y: 
- The ratio of zinc to copper is 7:11, which does not simplify. 
- This means that out of every 7+11=18 parts of the alloy, 7 parts are zinc and 11 parts are copper. 
- So in 60 grams of alloy Y, there are (7/18)*60 = 23.33 grams of zinc and (11/18)*60 = 36.67 grams of copper. 

Now we can add up the amounts of zinc and copper in the two alloys to find the total amount

Silu and Meenu were walking on the road.

(C) 27. 

If we let Meenu's weight be represented by "x", then we can set up the equation:

x = 29 + 0.5x

Simplifying this equation, we get:

0.5x = 29

x = 58

However, this answer doesn't make sense given that Meenu said she is overweight and her weight is less than Silu's weight. Therefore, we need to try another value for x.

Let's try x = 27:

27 = 29 + 0.5(27)

27 = 29 + 13.5

27 = 42.5

This equation is not true, so we need to try a smaller value for x.

Let's try x = 26:

26 = 29 + 0.5(26)

26 = 29 + 13

26 = 42

This equation is also not true, so we need to try an even smaller value for x.

Let's try x = 25:

25 = 29 + 0.5(25)

25 = 29 + 12.5

25 = 41.5

At its maximum speed, a space shuttle can travel 700m high in 40 seconds. It will also take 5 seconds to pass a point. What then is the length of the space shuttle? Answer Choices: (A) 50 m (B) 75 m (C) 100 m (D) 125 m (E) 150 m Among A through E, the answer is
To solve this problem, we need to use the formula:

distance = speed x time

First, let's find the speed of the space shuttle. We know that it travels 700m in 40 seconds, so:

speed = distance / time = 700m / 40s = 17.5 m/s

Next, let's find the time it takes for the space shuttle to pass a point. We know that it takes 5 seconds, so:

time = 5s

Now we can use the formula to find the length of the space shuttle. Let's call the length "L":

distance = speed x time
L + 700m = 17.5 m/s x 5s
L + 700m = 87.5m
L = 87.5m - 700m
L =  -612.5m

This answer doesn't make sense because the length of the space shuttle cannot be negative. Therefore, there must be an error in the problem. Please check the problem and try again.

When folded into two equal halves a rectangular sheet had a perimeter of 48cm for each part folded along one set of sides and the same is 66cm when folded along the other set of sides. Find the area of the sheet. Answer Choices: (A) 1584 (B) 1120 (C) 792 (D) 1320 (E) 1200 Among A through E, the answer is
The perimeter of the rectangle is 2(l + w) = 48, where l and w are the length and width of the rectangle. This can be simplified to l + w = 24. 

When folded along the other set of sides, the perimeter of each part becomes 66cm. This means that the length of each part is 33cm (since the width remains the same). 

So, we can write an equation for the area of the rectangle: 

Area = l * w 

We know that l + w = 24, and we can also see that the length of each part is l/2 = 33cm. So we can write: 

l = 66cm 
w = 24 - l = 24 - 66 = -42cm 

This doesn't make sense, so we need to go back and check our work. We made a mistake by assuming that the width of the rectangle remains the same when folded along the other set of sides. In fact, the width becomes the length of each part, which is 33cm. 

So, we can write: 

l + 2w = 48 
2l + w = 66 

Solving these equations simultaneously, we get:

We can simplify $727+728+729$ as $3(728)$. Since we are looking for three consecutive integers, we can express them as $n-1$, $n$, and $n+1$. Their product is $(n-1)(n)(n+1) = n(n^2-1) = n^3-n$. We know that $n^3-n = 3(728)$. Simplifying, we get $n^3-n-2184=0$. Factoring, we get $(n-12)(n^2+12n+182)=0$. The only real solution is $n=12$.

(D) 7890. 

To find the maximum number of students, we want to assume that all the fractions represent different groups of students. Therefore, we add up the fractions to get:

1/16 + 1/10 + 1/8 = 13/80

This means that 13/80 of the total number of students study one of these three subjects. To find the maximum number of students, we want to find the largest 4-digit number that is a multiple of 13/80. We can do this by dividing 9999 by 13/80 and rounding down to the nearest whole number:

9999 ÷ (13/80) ≈ 61538.46 → 61538

So the maximum number of students is 61538.

To find the minimum number of students, we want to assume that some of the fractions represent the same group of students.

A point on the edge of a fan blade that is rotating in a plane 10 centimeters from the center of the fan.

Answer Choices: (A) 750pi (B) 1500pi (C) 1875pi (D) 3000pi (E) 7500pi Among A through E, the answer is
The first step is to convert the rate of rotation from revolutions per minute to radians per second. 

300 revolutions per minute = 300/60 = 5 revolutions per second
1 revolution = 2π radians, so 5 revolutions = 10π radians per second

The distance traveled by the point on the edge of the fan blade is equal to the circumference of the circle it traces out. The radius of this circle is 10 centimeters, so the circumference is:

C = 2πr = 20π centimeters

To find the distance traveled in 30 seconds, we need to multiply the circumference by the number of times the circle is traced out in that time. The point on the edge of the fan blade traces out one circle every revolution, so in 30 seconds it traces out:

30 seconds * 5 revolutions per second = 150 revolutions

Therefore, the distance traveled is:

150 * 20π = 3000π

So the answer is (D) 3000π.

In a large forest, 300 deer were caught, tagged, and returned during 2001. During 2002, 500 deer were caught at random, of which only 20 had tags from the previous year. If the percent of deer in the forest that had tags during the second year and were caught in the 500 deer sample is representative of the percent of the total deer population in the forest with tags, what is the total deer population in the forest (assuming no change in population between 2001 and 2002)? Answer Choices: (A) 300 (B) 500 (C) 5000 (D) 6000 (E) 7500 Among A through E, the answer is
D) 6000. 

To solve this problem, we can use the concept of proportions. We know that the percentage of tagged deer in the sample of 500 is equal to the percentage of tagged deer in the entire population. 

Let x be the total deer population in the forest. 

From the information given, we know that:

- In 2001, 300 deer were tagged, which represents 300/x of the total population.
- In 2002, 20 of the 500 deer caught had tags from the previous year, which represents 20/500 of the sample or 20/x of the total population.

Setting these two proportions equal to each other, we get:

300/x = 20/x

Solving for x, we get:

x = 6000

Therefore, the total deer population in the forest is 6000.

The correct answer is (B) 91. 

Let's start by finding the sum of the 5 consecutive two digit odd numbers: 

x + (x+2) + (x+4) + (x+6) + (x+8) 

Simplifying this expression, we get: 

5x + 20 

We know that when this sum is divided by 10, it becomes a perfect square. Therefore: 

(5x + 20) / 10 = n^2 

Simplifying this expression, we get: 

x + 4 = n^2 

Now we can test each answer choice to see which one satisfies this equation: 

(A) 47 + 49 + 51 + 53 + 55 = 255 

255 / 10 = 25.5 (not a perfect square)

According to the second statement, if Mark gives one-third of his money to John, then John will have (2x/3) + (75/3) = (2x/3) + 25. 

Now we can set up an equation: 

(x/2) + 75 = (2x/3) + 25 

Multiplying both sides by 6 to eliminate the fractions:

D) 63 m. 

Let's start by using algebra to solve for the length and breadth of the rectangular piece. 

Let's say the breadth is x. Then, according to the problem, the length is 4x + 1. 

We know that the area of the rectangle is 150 sq m, so we can set up an equation: 

x(4x + 1) = 150 

Expanding the left side: 

4x^2 + x = 150 

Rearranging: 

4x^2 + x - 150 = 0 

Now we can use the quadratic formula to solve for x: 

x = (-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a 

Plugging in a = 4, b = 1, and c = -150: 

x = (-1 ± sqrt(1^2 - 4(4)(-150))) / 2(4) 

x = (-1 ± sqrt(1 + 2400)) / 8 

x = (-1 ± sqrt(2401)) / 8 

We can ignore the negative solution, since the breadth of the rectangle can't be negative.

Answer Choices: (A) $83 (B) $92 (C) $90 (D) $97 (E) $104 Among A through E, the answer is
The answer is (A) $83. 

Here's how to solve it: 

Let's call the worker's wage on the 8th day "x". 

We know that the worker's average wage for the entire 15-day period was $90 per day. So we can set up an equation: 

(15 days) x ($90/day) = total wages for the 15 days 

Simplifying this equation gives us: 

1350 = total wages for the 15 days 

We also know that the worker's average wage for the first 7 days was $87 per day. So we can set up another equation: 

(7 days) x ($87/day) + (8th day) x (x) = total wages for the first 8 days 

Simplifying this equation gives us: 

609 + x = total wages for the first 8 days 

We can do the same thing for the last 7 days: 

(7 days) x ($92/day) + (8th day) x (x) = total wages for the last 8 days 

Simplifying this equation gives us: 

644 + x = total wages for the last 8 days

Let's work through the problem step by step:

1. "If 6 yrs are subtracted from the present age of Ajay and the remainder is divided by 18, then the present age of Rahul is obtained." Let's call Ajay's present age "A". So we can write this as: (A - 6) / 18 = Rahul's age. 

2. "If Rahul is 2 yrs younger to Denis whose age is 5 yrs." Let's call Rahul's age "R" and Denis's age "D". So we can write this as: R = D - 2 and D = 5. Therefore, R = 3. 

3. Now we can substitute R = 3 into the equation we got in step 1: (A - 6) / 18 = 3. Solving for A, we get A = 60. 

4. However, we need to remember that this is Ajay's age after 6 years have been subtracted. So we need to add 6 to get Ajay's present age: A + 6 = 60 + 6 = 66.

If 10 is subtracted from 2/3 of a number the result is equal to sum of 40 and 1/3 of the number. Find the number Answer Choices: (A) 100 (B) 160 (C) 150 (D) 210 (E) 220 Among A through E, the answer is
C) 150. 

Let's start by setting up the equation: 

2/3x - 10 = 1/3x + 40 

To solve for x, we can start by getting rid of the fractions by multiplying both sides by the least common multiple of the denominators, which is 3: 

2x - 30 = x + 120 

Simplifying: 

x = 150 

Therefore, the answer is (C) 150.

The answer is (C) 2,100. 

To solve this problem, we can break it down into three parts: choosing the first consonant, choosing the vowel, and choosing the second consonant. 

There are 20 choices for the first consonant, since we can't use the same letter as the third consonant. There are 5 choices for the vowel, since it must be in the middle. There are 19 choices for the second consonant, since we can't use the same letter as the first consonant or the third consonant. 

Therefore, the total number of codes is 20 x 5 x 19 = 1,900.

The answer is (D) 9%. 

If 10% of the chocolates are cocoa flavored, then 90% of them must be vanilla flavored. So, out of 100 chocolates, 10 are cocoa flavored and 90 are vanilla flavored. 

Out of the 90 vanilla flavored chocolates, 90% of them are squashed, which means 10% of them are not squashed. 

Therefore, the percentage of chocolates that are both vanilla flavored and not squashed is 10% of 90, which is 9.

If the maximum number of trousers is purchased, then the amount spent on trousers will be the maximum possible amount. Let the number of trousers purchased be x, then the amount spent on trousers will be 70x. The remaining amount (810 - 70x) will be spent on shirts. 

Let's find the maximum number of trousers that can be purchased. We can set up an inequality: 

70x ≤ 810 

Dividing both sides by 70: 

x ≤ 11.57 

Since we can't purchase a fraction of a trouser, the maximum number of trousers that can be purchased is 11. 

So the ratio of trousers to shirts will be 11: (810 - 70*11)/30 = 11:9 

Therefore, the answer is (E) 11 Trousers.

A merchant receives an invoice for a motor boat for $20 000 with terms 4/30, n/100.

Answer Choices: (A) 247.67 (B) 237.67 (C) 227.67 (D) 215.67 (E) None of these Among A through E, the answer is
The answer is not provided in the given options. However, to calculate the highest simple interest rate, we need to find the cost of not taking the discount. If the merchant does not take the discount, he will have to pay the full amount of $20,000. If he takes the discount, he will have to pay 4% less, which is $20,000 x 0.96 = $19,200. 

Now, let's assume that the merchant borrows money to pay for the boat. If he borrows the full amount of $20,000 and pays it back within 30 days, he will have to pay an additional 4% in interest, which is $800. Therefore, he will end up paying $20,800 in total. 

To calculate the highest simple interest rate he can afford to borrow money at, we need to find the interest rate that will result in a total payment of $19,200. Let's call this interest rate "r". 

$20,000 x (1 + r) = $19,200 

Solving for "r", we get: 

r = -0.04 or -4% 

This means that the merchant cannot afford to borrow money at any interest rate

To solve this problem, we can use the concept of rates. Machine A produces 1 yo-yo every 6 minutes, which means its rate is 1/6 yo-yos per minute. Similarly, Machine B produces 1 yo-yo every 9 minutes, which means its rate is 1/9 yo-yos per minute. 

To produce 10 yo-yos, we need to find the total time it takes both machines to produce them. Let's call this time "t" in minutes. 

Using the formula: rate = output/time, we can set up the following equation: 

(1/6 + 1/9) * t = 10 

Simplifying this equation, we get: 

(3/18 + 2/18) * t = 10 

(5/18) * t = 10 

t = 10 * (18/5) 

t = 36 

Therefore, the answer is (C) 36 minutes.

Ram and Krishna start from A and B, respectively, at the same time and travel towards each other at constant speeds of 20m/s and 40m/s, respectively, along the same route.

Answer Choices: (A) 700 meters (B) 1000 meters (C) 700 kilometers (D) 555 meters (E) 600 meters Among A through E, the answer is
B) 1000 meters. 

We can start by using the formula: distance = speed x time. 

Let's assume that the distance between A and C is x meters. Then, the distance between C and B is (1000 - x) meters. 

Ram travels at a speed of 20m/s for 10 seconds, so he covers a distance of 20 x 10 = 200 meters. 

Krishna also travels for 10 seconds, but at a speed of 40m/s, so he covers a distance of 40 x 10 = 400 meters. 

When they meet at point C, the total distance covered by both of them is equal to the distance between A and C plus the distance between C and B: 

200 + 400 = x + (1000 - x) 

Simplifying this equation, we get: 

600 = 1000 - x 

x = 400 

Therefore, the distance between A and B is 1000 meters.

Answer Choices: (A) 46 (B) 81 (C) 126 (D) 252 (E) None Among A through E, the answer is
To find the area of the parking space, we need to know the length and width of the rectangle. Let's call the length L and the width W. 

We know that one side (W) is not painted and has a length of 9 feet. We also know that the sum of the lengths of the painted sides (2L + W) is 37 feet. 

2L + W = 37 

We can rearrange this equation to solve for L: 

2L = 37 - W 

L = (37 - W)/2 

Now we can substitute the value we know for W: 

L = (37 - 9)/2 

L = 14 

So the length of the rectangle is 14 feet and the width is 9 feet. 

The area of the rectangle is: 

A = L x W 

A = 14 x 9 

A = 126 

Therefore, the answer is (C) 126.

In a railway station, there are two trains going. One in the harbor line and one in the main line, each having a frequency of 10 minutes. The main line service starts at 5 o'clock and the harbor line starts at 5.02 A.M. A man goes to the station every day to catch the first train that comes. What is the probability of the man catching the first train? Answer Choices: (A) 0.9 (B) 0.8 (C) 0.6 (D) 0.65 (E) 1.5 Among A through E, the answer is
(B) 0.8. 

Here's why: 

The first train to arrive could be either the main line or the harbor line. 

If the main line train arrives first, the man will catch it if he arrives at the station anytime between 5:00 A.M. and 5:10 A.M. This is a 10-minute window, so the probability of him catching the main line train is 10/60 or 1/6. 

If the harbor line train arrives first, the man will catch it if he arrives at the station anytime between 5:02 A.M. and 5:12 A.M. This is also a 10-minute window, so the probability of him catching the harbor line train is also 1/6. 

Therefore, the probability of the man catching the first train is the sum of the probabilities of him catching either the main line or the harbor line train: 

1/6 + 1/6 = 2/6 = 1/3 

However, the question asks for the probability of him catching the first train, not just any train. Since there are two trains and he can only catch one of them, the probability of him catching the first train is 1/3

(D) 24. 

Here's how to solve the problem: 

Let's say the number is x. 

If 30 is subtracted from x, we get x - 30. 

According to the problem, x - 30 is equal to one third of x: 

x - 30 = (1/3)x 

Simplifying this equation, we get: 

(2/3)x = 30 

x = 45 

So the original number is 45. 

Now we need to find 50% of 45, which is: 

0.5 * 45 = 22.5 

However, be careful! The question is asking for 50% of the number AFTER 30 has been subtracted. So we need to find 50% of (45 - 30), which is: 

0.5 * 15 = 7.5 

But the question asks for the answer among A through E, and none of the answer choices is 7.5.

Answer Choices: (A) $45,000 (B) $50,000 (C) $54,000 (D) $59,000 (E) $62,000 Among A through E, the answer is
To solve this problem, we can use the formula for compound interest:

A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)

where A is the final amount, P is the principal (the amount Charles originally invested), r is the annual interest rate (8%), n is the number of times the interest is compounded per year (2 for semi-annual), and t is the number of years (1).

Plugging in the given values, we get:

54,080 = P(1 + 0.08/2)^(2*1)

Simplifying:

54,080 = P(1.04)^2

54,080 = 1.0816P

P = 54,080/1.0816

P = 50,000

The answer is (D) 2500/y. 

To see why, we can start by writing out the equation given: 

x = m/100 * 4y 

We want to express m as a percentage of x, so we can rearrange this equation to solve for m: 

m = 100x / (4y) 

Simplifying this expression, we get: 

m = 25x / y 

To express m as a percentage of x, we can divide m by x and multiply by 100: 

(m/x) * 100 = (25x/y) / x * 100 

Simplifying this expression, we get: 

(m/x) * 100 = 2500/y 

So m is 2500/y percent of x, which corresponds to answer choice (D).

Answer Choices: (A) 7 (B) 8 (C) 10 (D) 11 (E) 12 Among A through E, the answer is
(D) 11. 

Here's how to solve the problem: 

First, let's find the combined rate of painting for all three workers. We can do this by finding the fraction of a house each worker can paint in one day: 

- Mr. Brown can paint 1/6 of a house in one day 
- Mr. Black can paint 1/8 of a house in one day 
- Mr. Blue can paint 1/12 of a house in one day 

So the combined rate of painting for all three workers is: 

1/6 + 1/8 + 1/12 = 7/24 

This means that together, they can paint 7/24 of a house in one day. 

Now let's use this information to find out how much of the contract they can complete in 8 days with Mr. Brown and Mr. Black working: 

- In 8 days, Mr. Brown can paint 8/6 = 4/3 houses 
- In 8 days, Mr. Black can paint 8/8 = 1 house 

Together, in 8 days, they can paint 4/3 + 1 = 7/3 houses.

0.08x = minimum daily requirement of vitamin A

To find the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins, we need to add these two equations:

0.09x + 0.08x = minimum daily requirement of vitamin E + minimum daily requirement of vitamin A
0.17x = minimum daily requirement of both vitamins

Now we can solve for x:

x = minimum daily requirement of both vitamins / 0.17
x = (1 / 0.17) * (minimum daily requirement of both vitamins)
x = 5.88 * (minimum daily requirement of both vitamins)

Since we want to find the number of grams of the health food needed to provide at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the answer is (D) 14.5.

Of the 200 students in a school, at least 45% attended the prom night and at least 35% took part in the debating session. What is the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session? Answer Choices: (A) 27 (B) 81 (C) 90 (D) 99 (E) 110 Among A through E, the answer is
(D) 99. 

To find the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session, we need to find the minimum number of students who attended at least one of the events. 

If at least 45% attended the prom night, then at most 55% did not attend, which is 110 students. 

Similarly, if at least 35% took part in the debating session, then at most 65% did not take part, which is 130 students. 

To find the minimum number of students who attended at least one event, we need to subtract the maximum number of students who did not attend either event from the total number of students: 

200 - (110 + 130) = 200 - 240 = -40 

This doesn't make sense, so we know that at least one of our assumptions was incorrect. The only assumption we made was that at least 45% attended the prom night, so we know that this assumption must be incorrect. 

If we assume that exactly 45% attended the prom night, then 55% did not attend, which is 110 students. 

Similarly, if we assume that exactly 35% took part in the debating session, then 65

A cow is tethered in the middle of a field with a 14 feet long rope. If the cow grazes 10 sq.ft. per day, then approximately what time will be taken by the cow to graze the whole field? Answer Choices: (A) 51 days (B) 61 days (C) 71 days (D) 81 days (E) 91 days Among A through E, the answer is
To solve this problem, we need to find the area of the field. Since the cow is tethered in the middle of the field with a 14 feet long rope, the area that the cow can graze is a circle with a radius of 14 feet. 

The formula for the area of a circle is A = πr^2, where A is the area and r is the radius. 

So, the area of the field is A = π(14)^2 = 615.75 sq.ft. 

If the cow grazes 10 sq.ft. per day, then it will take the cow approximately 61 days to graze the whole field. 

Therefore, the answer is (B) 61 days.

A father wants to divide Rs. 5100 between his two sons, Mohan and Sohan who are 23 and 24 at present. He divides the amount in such a way that if their shares are invested at compound interest at 4% p.a. they will receive equal amount on attaining the age of 26 years. Find Mohan's share. Answer Choices: (A) 2400 (B) 2500 (C) 2600 (D) 2700 (E) None of these Among A through E, the answer is
Option (C) 2600 is the correct answer. 

Let Mohan's share be x. Then, Sohan's share will be (5100 - x).

According to the question, both Mohan and Sohan will receive equal amounts on attaining the age of 26 years. 

Using the compound interest formula, we can write:

x(1 + 0.04)^3 = (5100 - x)(1 + 0.04)^2

Simplifying this equation, we get:

x = 2600

Therefore, Mohan's share is Rs. 2600.

For bringing each copper coin from the bottom of a river, a coin-diver gets 20 cents, and for each brass coin she gets 25 cents. If after one dive, she got $3.40. What is the minimum number of copper coins that she brought? Answer Choices: (A) 4 (B) 3 (C) 2 (D) 1 (E) 0 Among A through E, the answer is
Let's assume that the coin-diver brought x copper coins and y brass coins. 

From the given information, we know that: 

- For each copper coin, the coin-diver gets 20 cents 
- For each brass coin, the coin-diver gets 25 cents 
- After one dive, she got $3.40 

Using this information, we can set up an equation: 

0.20x + 0.25y = 3.40 

To find the minimum number of copper coins that she brought, we need to find the smallest possible value of x that satisfies this equation. 

One way to do this is to use trial and error. We can start by plugging in answer choice A, which is 4: 

0.20(4) + 0.25y = 3.40 
0.80 + 0.25y = 3.40 
0.25y = 2.60 
y = 10.4 

Since y is not a whole number, this means that answer choice A is not correct. We can continue this process with the other answer choices until we find the correct one. 

Alternatively, we can simplify the equation by multiplying both sides by 100 to

The difference between simple interest and C.I. at the same rate for Rs.5000 for 2 years in Rs.72. The rate of interest is? Answer Choices: (A) 10% (B) 12% (C) 6% (D) 8% (E) 4% Among A through E, the answer is
The answer is (B) 12%. 

Explanation: 

Let the rate of interest be R%. 

Simple Interest for 2 years = (5000 x R x 2)/100 = 100R 

Compound Interest for 2 years = 5000[(1 + R/100)^2 - 1] 

Given, Compound Interest - Simple Interest = Rs. 72 

5000[(1 + R/100)^2 - 1] - 100R = 72 

Solving this equation, we get R = 12%.

A special cereal mixture contains rice, wheat and corn in the ratio of 2:3:5. If a bag of the mixture contains 3 pounds of rice, how much corn does it contain? Answer Choices: (A) 6.5 (B) 7.5 (C) 7 (D) 6 (E) None of the above Among A through E, the answer is
(D) 6 pounds. 

Since the ratio of rice to corn is 2:5, we can set up a proportion: 

2/5 = 3/x 

Cross-multiplying, we get: 

2x = 15 

x = 7.5 

So the bag of mixture contains 7.5 pounds of corn. However, the question asks for the amount of corn in a bag that contains 3 pounds of rice. 

Since the ratio of rice to corn is 2:5, we can use this ratio to find the amount of corn in a bag that contains 3 pounds of rice: 

2/5 = 3/x 

Cross-multiplying, we get: 

2x = 15 

x = 7.5 

So a bag of the mixture that contains 3 pounds of rice contains 7.5 pounds of corn. 

However, the question asks for the amount of corn in a bag that contains 3 pounds of rice, wheat, and corn combined. Since the ratio of rice to wheat to corn is 2:3:5, we can find the total amount of mixture in the bag: 

2x + 3x + 5x = 10x

Train ‘A’ leaves Mumbai Central for Lucknow at 11 am, running at the speed of 40 kmph. Train ‘B’ leaves Mumbai Central for Lucknow by the same route at 2 pm on the same day, running at the speed of 72 kmph. At what time will the two trains meet each other? Answer Choices: (A) 12 am on the next day (B) 5 am on the next day (C) 5 pm on the next day (D) 2 pm on the next day (E) None of these Among A through E, the answer is
The answer is (B) 5 am on the next day. The distance between Mumbai Central and Lucknow is the same for both trains, so we can use the formula: distance = speed x time. Let's call the time that Train A travels before meeting Train B as "t" hours. 

Distance covered by Train A = 40t 
Distance covered by Train B = 72(t-3) [since Train B starts 3 hours later than Train A] 

Since they are meeting each other, the total distance covered by both trains will be the same: 

40t + 72(t-3) = Distance 

Simplifying this equation, we get: 

112t - 216 = Distance 

We don't know the exact distance, but we don't need to. We just need to know when the two trains will meet, which is when they cover the same distance. 

So, we can set the two distances equal to each other: 

40t = 72(t-3) 

Solving for t, we get: 

t = 9 

This means that Train A travels for 9 hours before meeting Train B. Since Train A starts at 11 am, it will meet Train B at 8 pm

To solve the problem, we need to use the ratio of red sweets to green sweets, which is 3:4. This means that for every 3 red sweets, there are 4 green sweets. 

We are given that there are 120 green sweets, so we can set up a proportion: 

3/4 = x/120 

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply: 

4x = 3 * 120 

4x = 360 

x = 90 

Therefore, there are 90 red sweets in the bag. 

The answer is (A) 90.
