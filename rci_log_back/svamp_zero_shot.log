The Razorback t-shirt shop makes $ 78 dollars off each t-shirt sold. During the Arkansas game and the Texas tech game they sold a total of 186 t-shirts. If they sold 172 t-shirts during the Arkansas game How much money did they make from selling the t-shirts during the Texas tech game? The answer (arabic numerals) is
To find out how many t-shirts were sold during the Texas Tech game, we need to subtract the number of t-shirts sold during the Arkansas game from the total number of t-shirts sold: 

186 total t-shirts - 172 t-shirts sold during Arkansas game = 14 t-shirts sold during Texas Tech game 

To find out how much money they made from selling the t-shirts during the Texas Tech game, we can multiply the number of t-shirts sold by the profit per t-shirt: 

14 t-shirts sold during Texas Tech game x $78 profit per t-shirt = $1,092 

Therefore, they made $1,092 from selling the t-shirts during the Texas Tech game.

5. Mary needs to add 11 cups of sugar and 9 cups of salt according to the recipe. She has already added 12 cups of flour, which is not relevant to the question. Therefore, to find the difference between the cups of sugar and salt she needs to add, you simply subtract:

Debby bought 360 soda bottles and 162 water bottles when they were on sale. If she drank 122 water bottles and 9 soda bottles a day How many days would the soda bottles last? The answer (arabic numerals) is
To find out how many days the soda bottles would last, we need to first calculate the total number of soda bottles Debby has left after drinking 9 bottles a day. 

Total soda bottles left = 360 - (9 x number of days)

We can set this equal to zero to find the number of days it would take for Debby to finish all the soda bottles:

360 - (9 x number of days) = 0

Simplifying this equation, we get:

Number of days = 360 / 9 = 40

Therefore, the soda bottles would last Debby 40 days.

Jerry had some action figures on a shelf in his room. Later he added 2 more action figures to the shelf and removed 7 of the old ones. If there are 10 action figures on his shelf now How many action figures did he have initially on the shelf? The answer (arabic numerals) is
To solve this problem, we can use algebra. Let x be the initial number of action figures on the shelf. 

After Jerry added 2 more action figures, the total number of action figures on the shelf became x + 2. 

Then, Jerry removed 7 of the old ones, which means there were x - 7 old action figures left on the shelf. 

Finally, we know that the total number of action figures on the shelf now is 10. 

Putting it all together, we can write an equation: 

x - 7 + 2 = 10 

Simplifying, we get: 

x - 5 = 10 

Adding 5 to both sides, we get: 

x = 15 

Therefore, Jerry initially had 15 action figures on the shelf.
