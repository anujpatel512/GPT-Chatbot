1st data
A spaceship traveled 0.5 of a light-year from Earth to Planet X and 0.1 of a light-year from Planet X to Planet Y. Then it traveled 0.1 of a light-year from Planet Y back to Earth. How many light-years did the spaceship travel in all?
Let's think step by step.
Sure, let's break it down step by step. 

First, the spaceship traveled 0.5 light-years from Earth to Planet X. 

Next, it traveled 0.1 light-years from Planet X to Planet Y. 

Then, it traveled another 0.1 light-years from Planet Y back to Earth. 

To find the total distance traveled, we can add up these three distances: 

0.5 + 0.1 + 0.1 = 0.7 

So the spaceship traveled a total of 0.7 light-years.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is
The answer is 0.7 light-years.

During a visit to an orchard, Charlie picked 0.16666666666666666 of a bag of Golden Delicious apples, 0.16666666666666666 of a bag of Macintosh apples, and 0.3333333333333333 of a bag of Cortland apples. How many bags of fruit did Charlie pick in total?
Let's think step by step.
Sure, I can help you with that! 

First, we need to add up the fractions of bags that Charlie picked: 

0.16666666666666666 + 0.16666666666666666 + 0.3333333333333333 = 0.6666666666666666 

This means that Charlie picked 0.6666666666666666 of a bag of fruit in total. 

However, we want to know how many bags of fruit Charlie picked, not just a fraction of a bag. So we need to round our answer to the nearest whole number. 

Since 0.6666666666666666 is closer to 1 than it is to 0, we can round up to 1. 

Therefore, Charlie picked 1 bag of fruit in total.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is

Sure, I can help you with that! 

First, we need to figure out how much sugar Victor used in total. To do that, we can add the amount of brown sugar and white sugar he used: 

0.625 + 0.25 = 0.875 

So Victor used 0.875 of a scoop of sugar in total. 

Now, to figure out how much more brown sugar he used than white sugar, we can subtract the amount of white sugar from the total amount of sugar: 

0.625 - 0.25 = 0.375 

Therefore, Victor used 0.375 more scoops of brown sugar than white sugar.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is

The value of a sport utility vehicle this year is 16,000 dollars , which is 0.8 of what its value was last year. How much is the value of the vehicle last year?
Let's think step by step.
Sure, I can help you with that! 

To find the value of the vehicle last year, we can use a simple algebraic equation. Let's call the value of the vehicle last year "x". 

According to the problem, we know that the value of the vehicle this year is 0.8 times the value of the vehicle last year. So we can write:

16,000 = 0.8x 

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 0.8:

x = 16,000 ÷ 0.8 

x = 20,000 

Therefore, the value of the vehicle last year was 20,000 dollars.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is
The value of the vehicle last year is 20,000 dollars.

Let's think step by step.
Sure, I can help you with that! 

First, we need to find out how much gas Michelle used during her delivery route. To do that, we can subtract the amount of gas left in her car from the amount she started with. 

So, we can write the equation: 

Amount of gas used = Starting amount of gas - Amount of gas left 

Next, we need to plug in the values we have: 

Amount of gas used = 0.5 - 0.16666666666666666 

We can simplify this by subtracting the two values: 

Amount of gas used = 0.3333333333333333 

Therefore, Michelle used 0.3333333333333333 of a tank of gas during her pizza delivery route.

Let's think step by step.
Sure, let's break it down. We know that the two samples contained a total of 7,341 blood cells. We also know that the first sample contained 4,221 blood cells. To find out how many blood cells were in the second sample, we can subtract the number of cells in the first sample from the total number of cells. 

So, to find the number of blood cells in the second sample, we can use the equation:

Number of cells in second sample = Total number of cells - Number of cells in first sample

Substituting the values we know, we get:

Number of cells in second sample = 7,341 - 4,221

Simplifying the equation, we get:

Number of cells in second sample = 3,120

Therefore, there were 3,120 blood cells in the second sample.

How many leftover tarts did the restaurant have in all?
Let's think step by step.
Sure, let's break it down. First, we need to add up the fractions of tarts filled with each type of fruit: 

0.08333333333333333 (cherries) + 0.75 (blueberries) + 0.08333333333333333 (peaches) = 0.9166666666666666

So the restaurant had 0.9166666666666666 of a tart leftover. 

Next, we need to figure out how many whole tarts that is. We know that one whole tart is equal to 1, so we can divide 0.9166666666666666 by 1: 

0.9166666666666666 ÷ 1 = 0.9166666666666666

Let's think step by step.
Sure, I can help you with that! 

First, we need to find the total distance that Wendy covered, which is the sum of the distance she ran and the distance she walked. 

Total distance = distance ran + distance walked 

Total distance = 19.833333333333332 miles + 9.166666666666666 miles 

Total distance = 29 miles 

Now, to find how much farther Wendy ran than walked, we simply subtract the distance she walked from the distance she ran. 

Distance ran - distance walked = difference 

19.833333333333332 miles - 9.166666666666666 miles = difference 

Difference = 10.666666666666666 miles

Oceanside Bike Rental Shop charges 17 dollars plus 7 dollars an hour for renting a bike. Tom paid 80 dollars to rent a bike. How many hours did he pay to have the bike checked out ?
Let's think step by step.
Sure, let's break it down. 

First, we know that the rental shop charges a flat fee of 17 dollars, so we can subtract that from the total amount Tom paid: 

80 - 17 = 63 

This means that Tom paid 63 dollars for the hourly rate. 

Next, we can set up an equation to solve for the number of hours Tom rented the bike: 

7h = 63 

Where "h" represents the number of hours. 

Solving for "h", we can divide both sides by 7: 

h = 9 

So Tom rented the bike for 9 hours.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is
9.

Let's think step by step.
Sure, let's break it down step by step. 

First, let's find out how much Fred spent on the movie tickets. We know he paid $5.92 for each ticket, and he bought 2 tickets, so:

$5.92 x 2 = $11.84

Next, we add the cost of the borrowed movie:

$11.84 + $6.79 = $18.63

So Fred spent a total of $18.63.

Now we need to figure out how much change he received from his $20 bill. To do this, we subtract the total cost from the amount he paid:

$20 - $18.63 = $1.37

Therefore, Fred received $1.37 in change.

Bonnie's science class recorded the rainfall each day. They recorded 0.16666666666666666 of a centimeter of rain on Monday, 0.4166666666666667 of a centimeter of rain on Tuesday, and 0.08333333333333333 of a centimeter of rain on Wednesday. How many centimeters of rain did the class record in all?
Let's think step by step.
Sure, let's break it down. First, we need to add up the amount of rain recorded on each day. So, we have:

0.16666666666666666 + 0.4166666666666667 + 0.08333333333333333

Next, we can simplify the fractions by finding a common denominator. In this case, the common denominator is 6. So, we have:

1/6 + 5/6 + 1/12

Now, we can add the fractions together. To do this, we need to find a common denominator again. This time, the common denominator is 12. So, we have:

2/12 + 10/12 + 1/12

Adding these fractions together, we get:

13/12

Finally, we can simplify this fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by 12. This gives us:

1 and 1/12 centimeters of rain in total.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is
1.0833333333333333 centimeters of rain in total.

On Friday, Sam spent 2 pennies on ice cream. The next day, Sam spent 12 dimes on baseball cards. All in all, how much money did Sam spend?
Let's think step by step.
Sure, I can help you with that! 

First, let's convert the 2 pennies to dimes. Since there are 10 dimes in a dollar, there are 100 pennies in a dollar, and therefore 10 pennies in a dime. So, 2 pennies is equal to 0.2 dimes. 

Next, we can add the 0.2 dimes to the 12 dimes Sam spent on baseball cards. 

0.2 dimes + 12 dimes = 12.2 dimes 

Therefore, Sam spent a total of 12.2 dimes. If you want to convert this to dollars, you can divide by 10: 

12.2 dimes ÷ 10 = $1.22 

So, Sam spent $1.22 in total.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is

Mrs. Hilt measured the distance from her desk to the water fountain. It was 30 feet. How many feet will Mrs. Hilt walk on her trips to the fountain if she goes to the water fountain 4 times today?
Let's think step by step.
Sure, let's break it down. 

First, we need to figure out how many feet Mrs. Hilt walks to the water fountain in one trip. We know that the distance from her desk to the fountain is 30 feet, so that's the distance she walks in one direction. To go to the fountain and back to her desk, she would walk 30 feet there and 30 feet back, for a total of 60 feet per trip. 

Next, we need to multiply that distance by the number of trips she's making today. We know she's going 4 times, so we can multiply 60 feet per trip by 4 trips: 

60 feet/trip x 4 trips = 240 feet 

So Mrs. Hilt will walk 240 feet on her trips to the water fountain today.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is

Shannon, Brenda’s neighbor, joined Brenda in making bracelets. She brought 48 heart-shaped stones and wanted to have 8 of this type of stone in each of the bracelet she makes. How many bracelets with heart-shaped stones can Shannon make?
Let's think step by step.
Sure, let's break it down. First, we need to figure out how many heart-shaped stones Shannon has in total. To do that, we can multiply the number of stones she has by the number of stones she wants in each bracelet: 

48 stones * 8 stones per bracelet = 384 total stones 

So Shannon has 384 heart-shaped stones in total. 

Next, we need to figure out how many bracelets she can make with these stones. To do that, we can divide the total number of stones by the number of stones per bracelet: 

384 total stones / 8 stones per bracelet = 48 bracelets 

So Shannon can make 48 bracelets with heart-shaped stones.

John can read 4 books a day. John reads every Monday and Tuesday. How many books would John read in 6 weeks?
Let's think step by step.

First, let's figure out how many books John reads in a week. Since he reads every Monday and Tuesday, that's 2 days out of 7 in a week. So, he can read 4 books/day x 2 days/week = 8 books/week.

Next, we need to figure out how many weeks are in 6 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, 6 weeks is 6 x 7 = 42 days.

Finally, we can multiply the number of books John reads in a week by the number of weeks he'll be reading to get the total number of books he'll read in 6 weeks. So, 8 books/week x 6 weeks = 48 books. 

Therefore, John would read 48 books in 6 weeks.

Trenton sells electronic supplies. Each week he earns 190 dollars plus commission equal to 0.04 of his sales. This week his goal is to earn no less than 500 dollars. How much sales  he must make to reach his goal?
Let's think step by step.
Sure, let's break it down. First, we know that Trenton earns a base salary of $190 per week. Next, we need to figure out how much commission he needs to earn to reach his goal of $500. 

To do this, we can set up an equation: 

$500 = $190 + 0.04x 

Where x is the amount of sales Trenton needs to make. 

Now we can solve for x: 

$310 = 0.04x 

x = $7,750 

So Trenton needs to make $7,750 in sales to reach his goal of earning at least $500 this week.

Freeport McMoran projects the world grain supply will be 1800000 metric tons and the supply will be only 0.75 of the world grain demand. What will the world grain demand be?
Let's think step by step.
Sure, let's break it down. We know that the world grain supply is projected to be 1800000 metric tons, and that this supply will only be 0.75 of the world grain demand. 

To find the world grain demand, we can use the following formula: 

World grain demand = World grain supply / 0.75 

Plugging in the given values, we get: 

World grain demand = 1800000 / 0.75 

Simplifying this expression, we get: 

World grain demand = 2400000 metric tons 

Therefore, the world grain demand is projected to be 2400000 metric tons.

To find out how many oak trees the park will have when the workers are finished, we need to add the number of oak trees currently in the park to the number of oak trees the workers will plant today. 

So, 5 (current oak trees) + 4 (oak trees to be planted) = 9 oak trees in total when the workers are finished.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is
9.

At the beach, Janet and her sister both built sandcastles and then measured their heights. Janet's sandcastle was 3.6666666666666665 feet tall and her sister's was 2.3333333333333335 feet tall. How much taller was Janet's sandcastle than her sister's?
Let's think step by step.
Sure, I can help you with that! 

First, we need to find the difference between the heights of the two sandcastles. To do that, we can subtract the height of Janet's sandcastle from the height of her sister's sandcastle: 

2.3333333333333335 - 3.6666666666666665 = -1.333333333333333 

The result is negative, which means that Janet's sister's sandcastle was actually taller than Janet's sandcastle. 

To find the absolute difference between the two heights (ignoring the negative sign), we can use the absolute value function: 

|2.3333333333333335 - 3.6666666666666665| = 1.333333333333333 

So Janet's sandcastle was 1.333333333333333 feet taller than her sister's sandcastle.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is
The answer is 1.333333333333333 feet.

Sure, I can help you with that! First, we need to figure out how much money Sam earned from the pennies. Since he got 9 pennies, we can convert that to cents by multiplying 9 by 1 (since 1 penny is equal to 1 cent). So, Sam earned 9 cents from the pennies.

Next, we need to figure out how much money Sam earned from the quarters. Since he got 7 quarters, we can convert that to cents by multiplying 7 by 25 (since 1 quarter is equal to 25 cents). So, Sam earned 175 cents (or $1.75) from the quarters.

To find out how much money Sam has in total, we just need to add the amount he earned from the pennies to the amount he earned from the quarters. So, 9 cents + 175 cents = 184 cents (or $1.84). Therefore, Sam has $1.84 in total.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is
The answer is 184 cents or $1.84.

First, we need to add the amount of trout and salmon that the polar bear eats daily. 

0.2 + 0.4 = 0.6 

So the polar bear eats 0.6 of a bucket of fish daily. 

However, since the question asks for the answer in terms of buckets, we need to divide 0.6 by the amount of fish that fits in one bucket. 

Let's say that one bucket holds 5 pounds of fish. 

0.6 / 5 = 0.12 

Therefore, the polar bear eats 0.12 buckets of fish daily.

One evening, a restaurant served a total of 0.2 of a loaf of wheat bread and 0.4 of a loaf of white bread. How many loaves were served in all?
Let's think step by step.
Sure, I can help you with that! 

First, we need to add the amount of wheat bread and white bread served: 

0.2 + 0.4 = 0.6 

So, a total of 0.6 of a loaf of bread was served. 

However, the question asks for the number of loaves served, not the fraction of a loaf. To convert this fraction to a whole number, we need to divide by the size of a single loaf. 

Let's assume that each loaf is 1 unit. 

0.6 / 1 = 0.6 

So, a total of 0.6 loaves were served. 

However, we can't have a fraction of a loaf, so we need to round up to the nearest whole number. 

0.6 rounded up is 1. 

Therefore, one loaf of bread was served in total.

Therefore, the answer (arabic numerals) is
The answer is 1 loaf.

They entered the circus tent and saw that there are 4 sections for the audience. If each section can accommodate 246 people, how many people can the tent accommodate in total?
Let's think step by step.
Sure, let's break it down. First, we need to find the total number of sections in the circus tent. You mentioned that there are 4 sections, so we can write that as:

4 sections

Next, we need to find out how many people each section can accommodate. You mentioned that each section can hold 246 people, so we can write that as:

246 people per section

To find the total number of people the tent can accommodate, we need to multiply the number of sections by the number of people per section. So we can write:

4 sections x 246 people per section = total number of people the tent can accommodate

When we multiply 4 by 246, we get:

984 people

Therefore, the circus tent can accommodate 984 people in total.

When Joan was visited by the toothfairy, she received 14 each of quarters, half-dollars, and dimes. How much money did the toothfairy leave Joan?
Let's think step by step.
Sure, I can help you with that! 

First, let's find out how much money Joan received in quarters. Since she received 14 quarters, we can multiply 14 by 0.25 (the value of one quarter) to get:

14 x 0.25 = 3.50

So Joan received $3.50 in quarters.

Next, let's find out how much money she received in half-dollars. Again, we can multiply 14 by 0.50 (the value of one half-dollar) to get:

14 x 0.50 = 7.00

So Joan received $7.00 in half-dollars.

Finally, let's find out how much money she received in dimes. We can multiply 14 by 0.10 (the value of one dime) to get:

14 x 0.10 = 1.40

So Joan received $1.40 in dimes.

To find out how much money the toothfairy left Joan in total, we can add up the amounts she received in each coin:

$3.50 + $7.00 + $1.40 = $12.90

Therefore, the toothfairy left Joan $12.90 in

First, we need to figure out how many games Kelly needs to give away in total. To do this, we can subtract the desired number of games Kelly wants to have left (22) from the current number of games Kelly has (121):

121 - 22 = 99

So Kelly needs to give away 99 games in total.

Next, we need to figure out how many games Kelly needs to give away at once. To do this, we can subtract the desired number of games Kelly wants to have left (22) from the current number of games Kelly has (121), and then divide by the number of times Kelly wants to give away games:

(121 - 22) / x = 99

Simplifying this equation, we get:

99x = 99

x = 1

So Kelly needs to give away 1 game at a time until she has 22 games left.
