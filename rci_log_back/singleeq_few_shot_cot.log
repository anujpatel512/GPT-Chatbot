Q: Trenton sells electronic supplies. Each week he earns 190 dollars plus commission equal to 0.04 of his sales. This week his goal is to earn no less than 500 dollars. How much sales  he must make to reach his goal?
A:
Trenton earns 190 dollars plus 0.04 of his sales in commission. Let's call his sales "x". So his total earnings for the week would be 190 + 0.04x. We know he wants to earn at least 500 dollars, so we can set up the inequality: 

190 + 0.04x ≥ 500 

Subtracting 190 from both sides: 

0.04x ≥ 310 

Dividing both sides by 0.04: 

x ≥ 7750 

So Trenton must make at least 7750 dollars in sales to reach his goal of earning 500 dollars for the week. The answer is 7750.

Q: Freeport McMoran projects the world grain supply will be 1800000 metric tons and the supply will be only 0.75 of the world grain demand. What will the world grain demand be?
A:
Freeport McMoran projects the world grain supply will be 1800000 metric tons. This is only 0.75 of the world grain demand. Let's call the world grain demand "D". We can set up an equation: 0.75D = 1800000. To solve for D, we divide both sides by 0.75: D = 2400000. The world grain demand will be 2400000 metric tons. The answer is 2400000.

Q: For his long distance phone service Milan pays a 2 dollars monthly fee plus 12 cents per minute. Last month , Milan 's long distance bill was 23.36 dollars. For how many minutes was Milan billed for ?
A:
Milan pays a 2 dollar monthly fee plus 12 cents per minute. Let's call the number of minutes he was billed for "m". So his total bill can be expressed as 2 + 0.12m = 23.36. To solve for "m", we can subtract 2 from both sides to get 0.12m = 21.36. Then we can divide both sides by 0.12 to get m = 178. Therefore, Milan was billed for 178 minutes. The answer is 178.

Q: The sum of three consecutive odd numbers is 69. What is the smallest of the three numbers ?
A:
Let's call the smallest odd number "x". The next odd number would be "x+2" and the one after that would be "x+4". The sum of these three numbers is 69, so we can write an equation: x + (x+2) + (x+4) = 69. Simplifying this equation, we get 3x + 6 = 69. Solving for x, we get x = 21. Therefore, the smallest of the three numbers is 21.
